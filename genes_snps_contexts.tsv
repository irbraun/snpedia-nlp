BTBD9	Rs3923809	The authors of this study suggest that perhaps half of the cases of restless legs syndrome may involve the rs3923809 risk genotypes.
BTBD9	Rs3923809	Note that 70-80% of all individuals in European populations carry one or two copies of the (A) major allele, yet restless legs syndrome is thought to affect less than 10% of all adults.
BTBD9	Rs3923809	Consistent with this finding, another report about rs3923809 links the (G) minor allele to a lower frequency of restless legs syndrome with an overall odds ratio of 0.57 (CI: 0.48-0.68).
BTBD9	Rs3923809	Those with rs3923809 (A;A) genotypes, are estimated to be 1.9 fold more likely to have restless legs syndrome than rs3923809 (G;G) individuals.
BTBD9	Rs3923809	This SNP, located in an intron of the BTBD9 gene, has a variant that is seen somewhat more frequently in individuals with restless legs syndrome.
BTBD9	Rs3923809	Therefore, although an individual may be at higher risk based on their genotype, the genotype by itself certainly isnt able to predictably cause restless legs syndrome.The association between rs3923809 and RLS has been replicated in three European populations, and shows the most consistent effect across populations of several SNPs studied.The results of a 2013 study of Korean patients suggest that the role of BTBD9 in the pathogenesis of restless legs syndrome is more universal across populations than previously reported and more efforts should be focused on the role of epistasis in the genetic architecture of restless legs syndrome.
