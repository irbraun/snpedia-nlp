VPS35	Rs797044948	C.1463A>G (p.Gln488Arg) Reported as a disease causing mutation in ClinVar, however, only as an unspecified inborn genetic disease, with autosomal dominant inheritance.
VWF	Rs121964894	rs121964894, also known as c.2446C>T, p.Arg816Trp and R816W, is a SNP in the VWF gene on chromosome 12.The rare rs121964894 (T) allele is considered pathogenic for Von Willebrand disease, type 2N, according to ClinVar and the VWFdb.This SNP is also referred to as i5049115 by 23andMe.
VWF	I5049104	rs61750595 Von Willebrand disease.
VWF	I5049165	rs61749397 Von Willebrand disease.

WT1	Rs28941779	rs28941779, also known as Phe392Leu or F392L, is a SNP in the WT1 gene on chromosome 11.A report links a mutation at this SNP to the rare disease known as Frasier syndrome, which has similarities to Denys-Drash syndrome, no doubt in part since both are based on mutations in the WT1 gene.See also OMIM 607102.0025This variant meets the criteria published in 2013 by the ACMG regarding incidental findings in exome or genome sequencing, as a variant that they do recommend informing a patient about.

ZNRF3	Rs16986825	A 2014 study Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer of 7,683 European cases and 14,397 controls found the minor allele rs16986825 (T) in ZNRF3 (zinc and ring finger 3) conferring risk of statistically genome-wide significance (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.25, P = 1.2E-8) for Pancreatic cancer.
