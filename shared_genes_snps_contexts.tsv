ATM	Rs28904921	rs28904921, also known as c.7271T>G, p.Val2424Gly and V2424G, is a mutation in the ATM gene on chromosome 11.Although most high risk (causative) mutations for cancers prematurely truncate encoded proteins, the rs28904921 (G) mutation is a missense variant that appears to lead to a quite high relative risk for breast cancer (relative risk increase of 8.0, CI: 2.8 to 22.5, p=0.0005).
ATM	Rs28904921	In contrast to most BRCA mutations, which are considered tumor suppressors and functionally recessive, this ATM mutation is considered a dominant negative, since loss of the wild-type allele in tumors with the ATM mutation is not consistently observed.Note that the confidence intervals are quite large, so although the relative risk is calculated as increasing eight-fold, the authors cited indicate that they can only state with 95% confidence that the true increase in relative risk lies somewhere between 2.8 and 22.5.Somewhat similarly, a 2016 publication study involving 42,000 breast cancer cases concluded that rs28904921 (G) carriers had an odds ratio of 11 (CI:1.4-85; p=0.0012) and a 52% (CI: 28-80%) chance of developing the disease by age 70.

GDF5	Rs143383	The (T) allele appears to make less GDF5 protein, which eventually renders an individual somewhat more susceptible to osteoarthritis.A meta-analysis combining data from 11,000+ individuals as well as both European and Asian populations found strong evidence (p < 0.0004) confirming increased risk for osteoarthritis from the rs143383 (T) allele.
GDF5	Rs143383	The best model is a dominant one, and the odds ratio reported is 1.21 in general and 1.48 for the dominant model.Another meta-analysis of 14 studies concluded that rs143383 did indeed show significant association with osteoarthritis, at least for knee osteoarthritis, and probably for hand and hip (but to a lesser degree).
GDF5	Rs143383	The effect size wasnt large, though (odds ratio 1.15, CI: 1.09-1.22, p = 9.4 x 10e-7).A haplotype of rs143383 and rs6060369 can be defined, which also links osteoarthritis to height since rs6060369 was linked to height in a study ultimately involving over 28,000 individuals.The Medpage article on this finding notes that rs143383 was previously shown to be associated with increased risk for osteoarthritis and in this recent study it was significantly associated with shorter height in the initial scans, at p=2.70x10e-5.Note that the authors of refer to rs143383 in the opposite orientation compared to its entry in dbSNP.
