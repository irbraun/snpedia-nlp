ABCB1	Rs1045642	"rs1045642, also known as C3435T, is a SNP located in the ABCB1 gene. It is often studied in conjunction with rs2032582. C3435T has been mentioned by: A ""Silent"" Polymorphism in the MDR1 Gene Changes Substrate Specificity (for example, to verapamil) (R)-lansoprazole (Prevacid) concentrations are significantly increased in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers with ABCB1 C3435T C allele. In a Korean population, plasma concentrations of fexofenadine (Allegra) were 17% lower in 2677AA/3435CC subjects and 47% higher in the 2677TT/3435TT subjects compared to 2677GG/3435CC subjects. In contrast, in this study no association was observed between the C3435T polymorphism and fexofenadine plasma or urine concentrations in a German Caucasian population. A meta-analysis including 9 case-control studies (totaling ~2,500 patients) found no association between rs1045642 and epilepsy riskA study of 98 methadone-maintaining patients concluded that the higher (>150 mg/day) and lower (< or =150 mg/day) methadone dose groups differed significantly in their rs1128503 status (experiment-wise p = 0.0325). Furthermore, individuals with the 3-locus genotype pattern (T;T)-(T;T)-(T;T) for SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503, respectively, had an approximately 5-fold chance of requiring the 'higher' methadone dose, while individuals heterozygous for these three SNPs have an approximately 3-fold chance of stabilizing at the 'lower' methadone dose (point-wise p-value = 0.026).

CYP2C19	Rs4244285	rs4244285 is a SNP in the CYP2C19 gene, potentially encoding the CYP2C19 2 variant. This variant is the most common reason for poor metabolism of compounds like mephenytoin (an anti-convulsant), some antidepressants, the anti-platelet drug Plavix, and some drugs used for ulcer conditions of various types. The risk allele is rs4244285(A).As a nonfunctioning CYP2C19, this variant would be expected to be a poor metabolizer of several commonly prescribed drugs, including anti-ulcer drugs like omeprazole (trade names Losec and Prilosec), esomeprazole (trade name Nexium), and lansoprazole (trade name Prevacid).In Caucasians, SNPs in CYP2C19 are relatively rare (in contrast to SNPs in CYP2D6), but SNPs in this gene are common in Asians. Ulcer treatment with omeprazole to reduce Helicobacter pylori has been shown to vary depending on a patient's CYP2C19 genotype, varying from 28% in patients homozygous for CYP2C19 alleles encoding fully functional proteins to 100% in patients with variations leading to poor metabolism. The fact that poor metabolizers for many cytochrome p450s achieve higher therapeutic success for some drugs is speculated to be because for some of the drug being broken down (ie metabolized) slower, the effective concentrations are both higher and longer lasting. However, other drugs clearly work less well in carriers of reduced function CYP2C19 alleles. An example of such a drug is clopidogrel, sold under the brand name Plavix. This has now (2010) been acknowledged by the FDA, who have added a boxed warning to Plavix, alerting patients and health care professionals that the drug can be less effective in people who have CYP2C19 variants and cannot convert the drug as effectively to its active form. recent (December 2008) studies reach similar (though not identical) conclusions about the consequences of CYP2C19 2 allele carriers prescribed clopidogrel to reduce their cardiovascular risk: A study of 245 French patients under 45 years of age prescribed clopidogrel after surviving a first heart attack concluded that rs4244285(A) allele carriers were at 4x higher risk (CI: 1·81—9·02, p=0·0006) for subsequent adverse cardiovascular events compared to noncarriers. A study of 2,208 French patients prescribed clopidogrel, of which 225 subsequently died and 94 had a nonfatal heart attack or stroke, came to two conclusions : Patients carrying any two CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles ( 2, 3, 4, or 5), had about a 2x increased risk (21.5% vs. 13.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.98; CI: 1.10-3.58) for adverse cardiovascular events than CYP2C19 1 homozygotes. Among the 1,535 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty) during hospitalization, patients with two CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles were at even higher risk for adverse events: 3.58x (CI: 1.71-7.51) compared to CYP2C19 1 homozygotes. A study of 1,477 subjects with acute coronary syndromes who were treated with clopidogrel as part of the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TRITON-TIMI) 38 study concluded that rs4244285(A) allele carriers had a 1.53x increased risk for death from cardiovascula

DIO1	Rs8175347	The rs8175347 SNP consists of variation of a short (TA)(n) repeat sequence covering the TATA box of the UGT1A1 UDP-glucuronosyltransferase1A1 gene. This SNP is associated with hyperbilirubinaemia (Gilbert's syndrome) and adverse drug reactions, and is used for dosage advice for irinotecan. The low-activity (risk) alleles are rs8175347(TA)7 and (TA)8. UGT1A1 genetic polymorphisms, endogenous estrogen exposure, soy food intake, and endometrial cancer risk. Genome-wide association meta-analysis for total serum bilirubin levels. Serum bilirubin levels on ICU admission are associated with ARDS development and mortality in sepsis.

SERPINA1	Rs6647	The rs6647(T) allele encodes the more common (in Caucasians) Pi-M1V (for Val) allele; rs6647(C) encodes the Pi-M1A (for Ala) allele, thought to be the ancestral/original allele in humans but now somewhat less common than Pi-M1V.

TTC26	Rs13225917	e gene prevented normal development of photoreceptor sensory and other cilia. The protein is necessary for assembly of full length cilia, although the effect (if any) of rs13225917 on its functioning has not been determined. One publication speculates that this protein may play a role in Inherited Retinal Degeneration and so screening for TTC26 mutations in human ciliopathy|ciliopathies could be warranted, but to date there is no evidence supporting rs13225917 as a mutation of any consequence. TTC26/DYF13 is an intraflagellar transport protein required for transport of motility-related proteins into flagella. Knockdown of ttc26 disrupts ciliogenesis of the photoreceptor cells and the pronephros in zebrafish. The tetratricopeptide repeat: a structural motif mediating protein-protein interactions.

UGT1A1	Rs8175347	The rs8175347 SNP consists of variation of a short (TA)(n) repeat sequence covering the TATA box of the UGT1A1 UDP-glucuronosyltransferase1A1 gene. This SNP is associated with hyperbilirubinaemia (Gilbert's syndrome) and adverse drug reactions, and is used for dosage advice for irinotecan. The low-activity (risk) alleles are rs8175347(TA)7 and (TA)8. UGT1A1 genetic polymorphisms, endogenous estrogen exposure, soy food intake, and endometrial cancer risk. Genome-wide association meta-analysis for total serum bilirubin levels. Serum bilirubin levels on ICU admission are associated with ARDS development and mortality in sepsis. Pazopanib-induced hyperbilirubinemia is associated with Gilbert's syndrome UGT1A1 polymorphism. UGT1A1, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3 polymorphisms versus neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
