AANAT,Rs28936679,"rs28936679, also known as Ala129Thr or A129T (and also G619A), is a SNP in the aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase AANAT gene. The AANAT protein plays a unique role in vertebrate biology by controlling rhythmic production of melatonin in the pineal gland. Its activity increases 10- to 100-fold at night, leading to increased production and release of melatonin.In a 2003 report about Japanese patients with a sleep disorder known as susceptibility to delayed sleep phase syndrome, patient genotypes had a higher frequency of the rs28936679(A) allele.A later report based on Brazilian (primarily Caucasian) patients including those with delayed sleep phase syndrome found no variation at this SNP."

However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is to be confirmed. A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2032583(C) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates had better chances on remission. However,could not be reproduced in a large (~900) -trial with outpatient with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , the significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome among all studies with this SNP becomes insignificant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. However, the association remained significant after Bonferroni-correction in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients.rs2032583 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele. The 9 SNPs in the linkage block identified are :* rs2235067* rs4148740* rs2032583* rs4148739* rs11983225* rs2235040* rs12720067* rs7787082* rs10248420In contrast,  reported on two SNPs from the block, rs2032583 and rs2235040, that these SNPs are close to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (not inherited together) in their 81% white population.

ABCB1,Rs2235015,"rs2235015 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein (P-glycoprotein - Pgp) that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors PMID 28648553 and newer antidepressant drugs ,.  However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is still to be confirmed. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect on depression outcome and eight - that they do not. However those 18 studies are difficult to compare because they vary within their study design concerning following factors: population (ethnicity, psychiatric condition), tested SNPs, tested antidepressants (Pgp substrates and Pgp non-substrates) and doses, inclusion of drug metabolism monitoring and statistical correction for multiple testing.A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2235015(T) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates were more likely to remit. However, this result could not be reproduced in a large (N~900) trial with outpatients with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , no significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome with this SNP among all studies, but the association remained significant in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients. rs2235015 is near the 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele. The list of the 9 SNPs is shown below. rs2235015 has an r<sup>2</sup> value of >0.5 with this group :* rs2235067* rs4148740* rs2032583* rs4148739* rs11983225* rs2235040* rs12720067* rs7787082* rs10248420"

ABCB1,Rs2235040,"rs2235040 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is unconfirmed. In clinic, even the lower concentrations of drugs may achieve sufficient antidepressant effect, and the dose of the drug can be adjusted upwards until the patient responds. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect in depression and eight - that they do not.A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al.  found that rs2235040(A) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates were more likely to remit. However, this result failed to reproduce in a large (900 outpatient subjects) and better designed double-blind study of a well-researched ABCB1 substrate citalopram in depression (STAR-D study). According to a recent meta analysis , no significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome with this SNP. There was a significant association with treatment outcome in the inpatients subsample but data regarding rs2235040 and treatment outcome among inpatients entirely stemmed from the study by Uhr et al.The 9 SNPs in the linkage block identified are :* rs2235067* rs4148740* rs2032583* rs4148739* rs11983225* rs2235040* rs12720067* rs7787082* rs10248420In contrast,  reported on two SNPs from the block, rs2032583 and rs2235040, that these SNPs are in a weak disequilibrium (not always inherited together) in their 81% white population. Other results from  are unreliable because the authors used an antidepressant sertraline, which is, likely, not an ABCB1 substrate , as an example of an ABCB1 substrate and treated most of the patients in the study with sertraline."
