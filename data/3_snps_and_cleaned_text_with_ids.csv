AANAT,Rs28936679,"rs28936679, also known as Ala129Thr or A129T (and also G619A), is a SNP in the aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase AANAT gene. The AANAT protein plays a unique role in vertebrate biology by controlling rhythmic production of melatonin in the pineal gland. Its activity increases 10- to 100-fold at night, leading to increased production and release of melatonin.In a 2003 report about Japanese patients with a sleep disorder known as susceptibility to delayed sleep phase syndrome, patient genotypes had a higher frequency of the rs28936679(A) allele.A later report based on Brazilian (primarily Caucasian) patients including those with delayed sleep phase syndrome found no variation at this SNP.",1

ABCB1,Rs10248420,"rs10248420 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is unconfirmed. In clinic, even the lower concentrations of drugs may achieve sufficient antidepressant effect, and the dose of the drug can be adjusted upwards until the patient responds. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect in depression and eight that they do not. rs10248420 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele. The list of the 9 SNPs is shown below.When treated for depression with citalopram, paroxetine, amitriptyline, or venlafaxine (substrates of the protein encoded by ABCB1), a highly statistically significant association between the overall genetic variability of these SNPs and remission was reported by Uhr et al in a study of ~400 German inpatients..

Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and newer antidepressant drugs ,. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is to be confirmed. A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2032583(C) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates had better chances on remission. However,could not be reproduced in a large (~900) -trial with outpatient with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , the significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome among all studies with this SNP becomes insignificant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. However, the association remained significant after Bonferroni-correction in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients.rs2032583 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele.

Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors PMID 28648553 and newer antidepressant drugs ,.  However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is still to be confirmed. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect on depression outcome and eight - that they do not. However those 18 studies are difficult to compare because they vary within their study design concerning following factors: population (ethnicity, psychiatric condition), tested SNPs, tested antidepressants (Pgp substrates and Pgp non-substrates) and doses, inclusion of drug metabolism monitoring and statistical correction for multiple testing.A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2235015(T) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates were more likely to remit. However, this result could not be reproduced in a large (N~900) trial with outpatients with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1).

The risk of ischemic stroke was higher in Val allele homozygotes than in Met allele carriers. The adjusted hazard ratio for Val allele homozygotes, compared with Met allele carriers, was 1.50 (90% CI, 1.06 to 2.12) in whites and 3.62 (90% CI, 1.11 to 11.9) in black participants (Table 4).

A large study totaling 7,699 participants in the Framingham cohort and 4,148 participants in the Rotterdam cohort was conducted, with genome-wide significant SNPs then replicated in 11,000+ Caucasian and ~4,000 African-American individuals who took part in the study of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC). This study calculated an odds ratio of 1.74 for rs2231142 (CI: 1.51-1.99, p = 3.3x10e-15). A genetic score comprised of this SNP plus 2 others may stratify risk for gout. Among non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib, there's a 4-5x higher risk of diarrhea for rs2231142 heterozygotes (and presumably minor allele homozygotes), based on a study of 124 patients treated with 250mg oral gefitinib once daily.rs2231142 also appears to influence the effectiveness of rosuvastatin.

ADCY2,Rs13166360,"rs13166360 at 5p15.31 is located in an exon of adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2) and encodes a missense mutation (valine&#8594;leucine) in a transmembrane domain of the protein. A GWAS has associated '''rs13166360''' with bipolar disorder in people of European ancestry. == '''Clinical Background''' ==Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a severe mood disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and mania. BD has a lifetime prevalence of 1% in the general population (4% in the United States), and therefore can be classified as a common condition. To date, there does not exist any clear associations between race or socioeconomic status, and the onset of BD. Bipolar Disorders are amongst the 10 highest burden diseases, as ranked by the World Health Organization. In particular, those suffering from bipolar disorder are at a higher risk of suicide, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse . For further information about bipolar disorder, wikipedia offers a great article: .== '''SNP Data''' ==A GWAS by Muhleisen and coworkers links '''rs13166360''' to Bipolar Disorder. The authors were motivated by the success of a previous GWAS for bipolar disorder  that had not implicated the ADCY2 gene, and added additional subjects (2,266) and controls (5,028) in order to increase the power of this study. This data primarily comes from the MooDS (Systematic Investigation of the Molecular Causes of Major Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia) consortium. The new data unique to the Muhleisen et al study, which helped to find '''rs13166360''', was primarily genotyped on the Illumina Infinium assay. In all, the combined datasets analyzed ~2.3 million SNPs from 9,747 cases and 14,278 controls that are of European Ancestry, but who currently live in Europe, Australia and the USA. This represents the largest BD GWAS to date. The datasets were merged according to a standardized genomic control &#955;-factor (1.018) in order to control for p-value inflation. The meta-analysis found 56 SNPs that passed genome-wide significance at 5 distinct genetic loci. Of these 5 loci, 3 had been previously described (ANK3, ODZ4, and TRANK1), while two were completely novel (ADCY2 and the region between MIR2113 and POU3F2)'''Rs13166360''' was found as a proxy to another novel SNP (rs17836816) in the ADCY2 gene (r2=0.95), and presented genome-wide significance (p-value 1.81x10-8 with an allelic odds ratio of 1.14). Neither had previously been described in the context of Bipolar Disorder, and ADCY2 SNPs had not previously been associated with BD. '''Rs13166360''' describes a deviation from the major allele G to T (minor allele) that encodes a Valine to Leucine missense codon in ADCY2.== '''Relation to Disease''' ==There is consensus amongst the scientific and medical community that Bipolar Disorder is a multifactorial disease, with both genetic and environmental causes. ADCY2 is an integral membrane protein that, upon activation by heterotrimertic G proteins, catalyzes formation of the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that then activates protein kinase A (PKA) pathways. Many neurotransmitters function through G protein-coupled receptors, that in turn signal through these heterotrimeric G proteins. GPCRs represent a large pool of candidate genes for neuropsychiatric disorders, and accordingly, many antipsychotics target multiple receptors at once. Since ADCY2 is a signal integrator that acts downstream of many of these signaling pathways, any altercation to its function would occur downstream of multiple receptors and neurotransmitter pathways. It is not currently known if the V147L mutation is deleterious to the protein. While multiple adenylate cyclase genes exist, ADCY2 is uniquely expressed in the brain.",180

ADH1C,Rs283413,"rs283413, also known as c.232G>T, p.Gly78Ter, G78stop and Gly78X, encodes a rare variant of the ADH1C gene that leads to a truncated alcohol dehydrogenase protein. These types of proteins are involved in detoxification and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The rs283413(G) allele is the more common, encoding the amino acid glycine (Gly); the quite rare rs283413(T) allele encodes the variant stop codon (X). Originally identified in three Swedish patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), a study of ~1000 PD patients vs. ~1000 controls indicated an odds ratio for the risk allele of 3.25 (CI:1.31-8.05). This risk is effectively for heterozygotes, since the risk allele is so rare that no homozygotes for it were observed. In a study of 40 index cases, 10% were found to harbor the rs283413(T) risk allele. On its own, this SNP is also said to explain 9.0% of the variability in the rate at which alcohol is metabolized, based on a study of 250 Spaniards. More significantly (in a statistical sense), this study concluded that combinations of this SNP and others were shown to affect alcohol metabolism; most of these combinations are represented by the gs211 genoset.

In ""Association of the ADRA2A polymorphisms with the risk of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis."" a meta-analysis of publications prior to September 2012 showed no overall association between rs553668 and T2D risk, but did find an association with very high (poor) P-value for Europeans under recessive gene model (GT=AA, OR=1.36, p=0.02, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.76).In ""Genetic association of adrenergic receptor alpha 2A with obesity and type 2 diabetes."" rs553668 was found to correlate with obesity in Swedish population, but not significantly for BMI-corrected T2D risk. ADRA2A is involved in sympathetic nervous system's inhibition of insulin secretion and lipolysis, so direct effect on T2D is usually sought, but the Swedish study suggest it could work through body mass.

ADRA2B,Rs2229169,"This is a good proxy for alpha-2B-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2B) deletion polymorphism (del301–303; rs4066772). The minor rs2229169 allele was in a strict linkage disequilibrium with the deletion of three amino acids in ADRA2B (Ins/Del301-303) in a mixed African–American/white group  and in a large Chinese study .Alpha-2B adrenergic receptors contribute to norepinephrine stimulation in the brain and to peripheral vasoconstriction. The deletion polymorphism del301–303 encodes a version of the receptor that, unlike normal alpha-2B receptors, fails to decrease its activity (desensitize) in response to prolonged stimulation . This may result in both negative cardiovascular consequences and positive cognitive effects.A large population cohort of Finnish middle-aged men (1606 men, mean age at the start 53 years) was followed for the average time of 18 years. Acute coronary events defined as hospitalizations for myocardial infarction or prolonged acute chest pain were more frequent in the men with del301–303 polymorphism: Del/Del OR=1.57 (P=0.002), Del/Ins OR=1.25 (P=0.077), Ins/Ins OR=1. Associations with the number of sudden cardiac deaths and overall cardiac heart disease mortality were also observed, but they would not be significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. A study of Koreans compared more than 600 patients hospitalized for an ischemic stroke with control subjects. The deletion polymorphism conferred higher risk of ischemic stroke: Del/Del OR=1.78 (P=0.007), Del/Ins OR=1.25 (P=0.107), Ins/Ins OR=1. Association of the deletion genotype with small-vessel disease was the main contributor to the risk. In a study of more than 400 young Swiss adults, the carriers of del301–303 polymorphism had about 20% better memory for emotional photographs, both positive and negative. This enhancement of emotional memory was selective: the level of emotions caused by the photographs, the memory for neutral photographs, working memory, and attention were not dependent on genotype. Among the Rwandan genocide refugees, the same authors found the deletion to be associated with increased re-experiencing of traumatic events but independently from PTSD, which was distributed equally among the genotypes.

Medical conditions that may be linked to the rarer (minor) rs2494732(C) allele include drug response, schizophrenia, and drug-related psychoses, in particular, cannabis-related psychosis.  A study of 442 healthy, once-a-month cannabis users between the ages of 16-23 to see if AKT1 variants influenced acute psychosis response concluded that the number of rs2494732(C) alleles predicted (p = 0.015) acute (i.e. temporary) psychotic response to cannabis. Basically, the more copies someone had of this SNP, the more likely they were to have mind-altering symptoms while stoned. Other factors studied, including gender, ethnicity, and years of cannabis use, did not predict whether they would have these (transient) symptoms. Note that this side-effect (psychosis or paranoia) was infrequent in an absolute sense regardless of genotype. A case-control study of 489 first-episode psychosis patients concluded that while rs2494732 was not associated with an increased risk of a psychotic disorder, with lifetime cannabis use, or with frequency of use, there was a significant association between psychosis and cannabis use. rs2494732(C;C) individuals with a history of cannabis use had an increased likelihood of a psychotic disorder (odds ratio 2.18, CI: 1.1 - 4.3) when compared with users who were (T;T) carriers. The interaction between the rs2494732 genotype and frequency of use was also somewhat significant (likelihood ratio = 13.39; p = .010).

The orientation of this SNP was flipped from being on the FWD strand in the human genome assembly GRCh37 to being on the REV strand in assembly GRCh38; then in August 2015 an alert SNPedia user alerted us to the fact that it has somehow flipped back to being on the FWD strand in dbSNP again, whereas in 2017 and now (2018) it is back on the REV strand. This SNP is clearly prone to confusion.23andMe has a second SNP (in addition to rs1800546) assaying this position, which is identified as i5012663.rs1800546 is located on chromosome 9q31.1 within the aldolase B fructose bisphosphate ALDOB gene.  rs1800546 is linked to approximately 65% of hereditary fructosuria (also known as fructose intolerance or HFI) cases in those of European ancestry.  The incidence of HFI in those of European ancestry is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 births.  HFI is an autosomal recessive condition.  This SNP is an ambiguous flip prone to some confusion (see warning at top of page), but to be clear, in SNPedia the current orientation for the ancestral allele of this SNP is now G, while the risk-associated allele is C. Note: Reports from DNA testing labs may be not be clear which strand is being reported. Aldolase B is a critical enzyme involved in the breakdown of the sugar fructose through the glycolysis pathway.  The nucleotide change results in an amino acid substitution at position 149 from alanine to proline (A149P).==CLINICAL OVERVIEW:==Aldolase B fructose bisphosphate catalyzes the reversible reaction of fructose-1-phosphate to glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate.  Further conversion of these 3-carbon products allows the byproducts of fructose metabolism to enter into the glycolysis pathway.  Homozygous loss of function of aldolase B leads to an inability of the body to break down fructose into byproducts for human consumption.  Due to the continuation of the first step in fructose breakdown, the conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, a phosphate sink is created in these patients, in which all the available phosphate is consumed in the cell.  This leads to the halt of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.  Symptoms usually begin at the time of weaning and include: bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, mental depression, jaundice, and cirrhosis that can lead to liver failure and death.   Many patients display a food aversion to fructose-rich foods and practice strict avoidance of fructose-containing foods before their diagnosis.  The current gold standard for testing of fructose intolerance is the hydrogen breath test, in which the patient is administered fructose in the clinical setting, and hydrogen levels are measured before and at intervals after administration of the bolus of fructose.  An increase in hydrogen produced reflects the failure of the patient to absorb fructose, which is then metabolized by bacteria in the gastrointestinal system to give off hydrogen.  The disadvantage of this test is that many patients respond to the fructose administration with signs of severe hypoglycemia including altered consciousness, diaphoresis, and seizures, sometimes resulting in death.  Therefore, elucidation of the causes of HFI and available genetic testing can avert the extreme clinical risks associated with standard of care diagnosis. There is currently no cure for HFI, with the only treatment strict diet modifications to avoid fructose-containing foods.==RISK-ASSOCIATED SNP:==Numerous studies identify and characterize the deleterious nature of the A149P missense mutation, corresponding to rs1800546. In 1988, Cross, et. al first described the genetic based for HFI in four patients as a G→C transversion in the coding sequence of exon 5 at position 149, resulting in an amino acid substitution of alanine to proline in a critical substrate binding region.  PCR amplification revealed the A149P substitution in the proband and 4 members of the pedigree, showing the carrier status of the parents and one sibling, and the affected proband and another sibling,  A case study of seven unrelated Italian patients with HFI was conducted in 2004 looking at the mutational spectrum within the aldolase B gene.  The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was used to perform sequencing of patient DNA for known and novel mutations in the aldolase B gene.  The nine exons, splice junctions, and promoter region were sequenced in each patient. In contrast to American mutations, in which the two most common mutations A149P and A175D account for 85-90% of phenotypes, they account for only 65% of patients in Italians, with many more rare mutations accounting for the remainder of the genetic basis underlying HFI.  In 2005, the structures of the wild type and mutant aldolase B were published by Malay, et. al., revealing a thermolabile mutant.  The A149P mutant is reported to lose catalytic function at temperatures > 15°C, to lose tertiary structure at 33°C, and to lose its secondary structure at 45°C.  The structural constraints placed by the mutant amino acid proline disrupt the secondary structure of the β-sheet, with further reaching implications for the nearby catalytic site, including the neighboring arginine at position 148 and its interactions with Glu189 and Arg303.  The mutant structure was found to have only low levels of catalytic activity in vivo, with a T1/2 of 25°C, corresponding to almost no activity at body temperature of 37°C.  In 2008, Davit-Spraul, et. al screened the molecular basis of HFI in 160 patients from 92 families by PCR-restriction.  Patients for which mutations could not be found were further investigated using exon scanning and LR-PCR to search for novel mutations and deletions or insertions.  In 75% of patients, the three most common mutations, including A149P, were identified.  15% of patients were found to have one A149P mutation with a rare or novel compound heterozygous mutation elsewhere in the aldolase B sequence.

AMPD1,Rs17602729,"This position is odd. Under the older reference genome build36, it was on the plus strand; in build37 it is on the minus strand. This makes it very prone to some ambiguous flip confusion in the literature, plus, 23andMe users have self-reported the flipped form. IN addition, instead of the usual SNP listed as having 2 alleles, all 4 alleles are reported in dbSNP, even if this is probably due to the strand changes. dbSNP currently says the normal allele is C, and T is the rare geno which causes a premature stop, early in the gene. We at SNPedia suspect that the A & G alleles are not common enough to have ever been genuinely reported, but for de-novo mutations each allele would be non-synonymous and result in a different amino acid. , a SNP located in the AMPD1 gene and also known as 'C34T', has at times been called the ""most prevalent genetic disease mutation"", at least in Caucasians.  Perhaps up to 10% of Caucasians and African-American carry one C34T allele (i.e. carry one rs17602729(A) allele) - and actually, most of them are unaware of any medically related issues since they don't typically have any particular symptoms that would warrant a trip to the doctor.So what's the issue? The AMPD1 gene encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase, which is one of the key enzymes used to process the energy source ATP. The C34T variation causes a premature stop in the protein, leading to a nonfunctional AMPD1 enzyme. Some individuals - but by no means all or even a majority apparently - who are AMPD1 deficient get muscle cramps and pains when they exert themselves. The most common genotype bringing this about is rs17602729(A;A), i.e. the individuals who carry two copies of the C34T allele and therefore have no functioning AMPD1 allele. It is not known why only some of C34T homozygotes experience muscle myalgia.Heterozygotes, i.e. rs17602729(A;G) individuals, do not seem to suffer any exercise or fitness related deficit. In fact, one of the best elite Caucasian distance runners is known to be a C34T heterozygote. In fact, heterozygotes for rs17602729 may even have advantages over those lacking a C34T allele. The most striking study reported that C34T heterozygotes are 8.6 fold (CI: 3.05 - 23.87) more likely to survive for more than 5 years without needing a heart transplant after a congestive heart failure related hospitalization than the wild-type homozygotes (i.e. rs17602729(G;G) homozygotes).  Similarly, C34T heterozygotes with coronary artery disease seem to fare better than wild-type homozygotes. This is one of the SNPs reported by NutraHacker SNPs|NutraHacker.",337

ANKK1,Rs1800497,"rs1800497, a SNP also known as the TaqIA (or Taq1A) polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor DRD2 gene (even though it is actually located over 10,000bp downstream of the gene), gives rise to the DRD2 A1 allele, whereas rs1800497(C) gives rise to the DRD2 A2 allele. The minor allele (i.e. A1, rs1800497(T)) is associated with a reduced number of dopamine binding sites in the brain , and it has been postulated to play a role in alcoholism, smoking, and certain neuropsychiatric disorders.The reduced number of dopamine binding sites may play a role in nicotine addiction by causing an ""understimulated"" state that can be relieved by smoking (and/or use of other drugs). It may also be associated with reduced response to errors and increased addictive behavior.A wide variety of reports have been published over more than ten years either linking rs1800497 to aspects of nicotine use and smoking cessation success, or finding no such association. A meta-analysis of 41 such studies published in 2004 concluded that overall the association of rs1800497 with such phenomena was statistically weak.  This same group published (in 2009) a study showing no association between rs1800497 and improved response to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), contrary to their previous study.More recently, a relatively large study of over 700 patients attempting to kick their smoking habit using the drug bupropion determined that smokers homozygous for the A2/A2 genotype were more successful than A1/A2 or A1/A1 individuals. The A2/A2 smokers were more than three times as likely, relative to placebo, to be abstinent at end of treatment (35.2% vs. 15.1%; odds ratio = 3.25, CI: 2.00-5.28) and at 6 months of follow-up (26.7% vs. 12.2%; odds ratio = 2.81, CI: 1.66-4.77), whereas not so much by 12 months (16.3% vs. 10.7%; OR = 1.70, CI: 0.95-3.05). Basically, A1/A2 and A1/A1 genotype smokers didn't gain anything from using bupropion versus placebo; bupropion only helped A2/A2 genotypes stop smoking. In a study of individuals in the Polyp Prevention Trial with any, multiple (>/=2) or advanced colorectal adenoma recurrence after 4 years, compared to those without adenoma recurrence, rs1800497(T;T) individuals were significantly associated with all advanced adenoma recurrence (odds ratio 2.40, CI: 1.11-5.20).  The authors speculate this increased risk of adenoma recurrence (and an association with colorectal cancer) may be related to SNP-associated differences in alcohol and fat intake.A 2014 preliminary study links an individual's ANKK1 rs1800497 genotype as likely to experience greater positive subjective effects following cocaine exposure, including greater 'high' and 'like', and these individuals may have increased vulnerability to continue using cocaine or they may be at greater risk to relapse during periods of abstinence. The study states that replication of these findings is necessary to confirm these findings.SNPs rs6276, rs6277, and rs1800497) in the human DRD2 gene are associated with decreased D2R expression and function, as well as high blood pressure.  Data supports the hypothesis that D2R function has protective effects in human renal proximal tubule cells hRPTCs and suggest that carriers of these SNPs may be prone to chronic renal disease and high blood pressure.  SNPs, rs1800497 and rs2283265, located near and within the dopamine receptor 2 DRD2 gene, respectively, were significantly associated with improvements during working memory training (p < .003 and p < .0004, respectively).

One publication states the presence of this minor allele raises the risk of colon cancer 11 fold; other publications find no increase in risk.Note that normally, APC gene mutations associated with FAP are dominant (and highly penetrant).

A 2019 study  reported that that a carrier of a pathogenic PSEN1 mutation, known to cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease, who was also a homozygous ApoE3ch carrier, did not show cognitive symptoms before her seventies, almost three decades after expected onset. Autosomal dominant forms of Alzheimer's disease and sporadic Alzheimer's disease show largely similar pathogenesis. Likewise, common APOE alleles(ApoE-ε2, ApoE-ε3, and ApoE-ε4) have similar effects in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (, ApoE-ε4 carriers have earlier onset, ApoE-ε2 alleles have later onset). Together, this these findings suggest that being a homozygous ApoE-ε3ch carrier will potentially also convey protection against sporadic Alzheimer's disease.

The minor allele of rs199768005 is in phase with the APOE epsilon 3 allele. p.V236E divides the epsilon 3 haplotype into epsilon 3b (the minor allele of rs199768005) and epsilon 3a (major allele of rs199768005). The risk of AD among those with epsilon 3b genotype was substantially reduced(OR=0.11,0.02-0.36, P=2.32x10-3). This decrease in AD risk was AD independent of the epsilon 2, 3 and 4 alleles. If confirmed, this rare genotype might reduce risk of AD more than the well-known epsilon 2 genotype.Within the context of AD, the minor allele of rs199768005 appears to reduce disease risk. However, it is cited on this page and dbsnp as pathogenic in the context of Familial type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia.",394

A new (Dec 2008) meta-analysis concludes that, yes, indeed, rs2373115 is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease among ApoE4 carriers, with an odds ratio of 1.58 (CI: 1.17 - 2.14, p = 3 x 10e-3), but only among carriers.

If the allele is (C) and the same chromosome also harbors the rs7412(C) allele, the combination is known as an APOE-ε4 allele. The APOE-ε4 allele has a strong influence on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Many studies have estimated the level of risk, and it varies depending on age, sex, ethnicity, and other factors. One meta-analysis estimated the odds ratios for homozygous rs429358(C;C) individuals compared to the more common ApoE3/ApoE3 homozygotes to be 12x for late-onset Alzheimer's and 61x for early-onset disease. Meta-analyses have also supported the association between the APOE-ε4 allele and somewhat increased risk for heart disease, with an odds ratio of 1.42 (CI: 1.26 - 1.61).Note: Although ApoE status is technically defined by these two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412, a SNP in the adjacent ApoC1 gene, rs4420638, is co-inherited with ApoE and thus often - though not completely - predictive of it.",400

APOE,Rs4420638,"Apolipoprotein E ApoE status is technically defined by two different SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412.  This SNP, rs4420638, is situated about 14kb away in the adjacent ApoC1 gene and is co-inherited with ApoE and thus associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.rs4420638 (the proxy SNP) is not independent of rs429358. These two SNPs are correlated with each other and it's believed that most of the association with AD at rs4420638 is due to its proximity to rs429358. That said, rs4420638 is not a perfect proxy for rs429358 either -- rs4420638 correlates better for certain genotypes and for certain ethnicities. For example, if you have the genotype at rs4420638 that is more correlated with the e4 allele of APOE, you still only have a 50% chance of actually having the e4 allele. And rs4420638 is not very predictive for any genotype in African populations. The (G;G) form of this SNP indicates increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, however the probability and amount of increased risk is subject to some disagreement. The initial report concerning this SNP indicated a high likelihood that rs4420638(G;G) homozygotes were predictably ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes and thus at significantly (15 fold or higher) risk for Alzheimer's. However, one testing service has estimated pers. communication that 25% to 50% of people with the (G;G) are  not  actually ApoE4 homozygotes, and are more likely to be at ~2-3x increased risk based on being ApoE3/ApoE4 heterozygotes. If you were tested on deCODEme or 23andMe v3 platform, ignore this proxy and just check your status at rs429358 and rs7412. 23andme added rs429358 for people who tested on the v3 platform on 04/14/2011, so you should re-download your data if you haven't.This  AlzForum.org article suggests that ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes have a ~15-fold increased risk for developing the disease compared to ApoE3/ApoE3 carriers, whereas rs4420638(A;G) individuals have a ~3-fold increased risk.ApoE4 status is notable as being the variation that several well known scientists, including Nobel Prize winner User:Watson|James Watson, request not to learn when having their own genomes analyzed.Meta-analyses have also supported the association between the ApoE4 allele and somewhat increased risk for heart disease, with an odds ratio of 1.42 (CI: 1.26 - 1.61)./ 23andMe blog each rs4420638(G) lowered CRP by 21.8% also associated with higher total cholesterol, LDL choelsterol and triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterolNote: the :Category:On_chip_Affy500k|Affymetrix 500K chip is said to poorly tag (ie assay) this particular SNP.

ARMS2,Rs10490924,"rs10490924, also known as c.205G>T, p.Ala69Ser and A69S, was identified as a risk factor from chromosome 10 related to age related macular degeneration. The risk allele is (T). Odds ratios for heterozygotes and homozygotes are, respectively, 2.69 (CI: 2.22-3.27) and 8.21 (CI: 5.79-11.65).Disease risk in combination with the rs1061170 SNP in the CFH gene is dramatically increased. Homozygotes for both the rare/risk alleles at both loci are estimated to be at 57 fold higher risk for age related macular degeneration than individuals homozygous for the common alleles at both loci. A subsequent study indicated that the risk based on solely the ARMS2 SNP rs10490924 is significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. Based on a study of ~750 patients, rs10490924 is significantly higher in participants with choroidal neovascularization than in those with geographic atrophy (odds ratio 1.37, CI: 1.21-1.54, p = 4.2 &#215; 10(-7)).Note that this SNP is completely predictive (ie is in perfect linkage disequilibrium) with rs11200638, thus the status of one predicts the status of the other. A likely biological mechanism is that the A69S change in the LOC387715/ARMS2 protein affects its presumptive function in mitochondria. rs10490924 and rs11200638 defined 2 significant haplotypes associated with increased risk of neovascular AMD. In comparison with wild-type homozygosity (G;G), homozygosity for the at-risk allele genotype (T;T) increased the likelihood for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) 8.4-fold (CI: 3.6-19.5) and heterozygosity for the at-risk allele genotype (G;T) increased the risk for PCV 4x (CI: 1.9-8.4), based on a study of ~100 Japanese patients.

ARNTL,Rs10766071,"Rs10766071 is a SNP in aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (ARNTL). Rs10766071 has been associated with shorter sleep duration as measured by polysomnography&#8212; a method for recording the activity of the brain, eyes, muscles, and heart while the subject sleeps. The A allele (major allele) is associated with higher sleep duration and the G allele (minor allele) is associated with shorter sleep duration (n=414). However, only one individual with the GG genotype was in the study. G is the ancestral allele and is also the minor variant (frequency = .0851) (dbSNP).ARNTL encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS domain transcription factor (PMID:11163178).Studies have shown that ARNTL is an important component of the transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) which regulates circadian rhythms. Homozygous ARNTL null mutant mice loose circadian rhythmicity, as measured by activity patterns, when transferred to constant darkness, demonstrating that ARNTL plays a key role in maintaining circadian rhythmicity (PMID:11163178). Rs1076671 was one of 13 significant SNPs (after Bonferroni correction) discovered by Kripke et al. (PMID:25660813) to be associated with sleep variables. Their study consisted of a cohort of patients of likely European ancestry who were recruited from a &#8220;busy academic sleep practice.&#8221; Patients consisted mostly of individuals who had been given a tentative diagnosis of sleep apnea, and had been sent for a polysomnography to confirm. All patients were 21 years or older.The authors of the paper collected DNA samples from the patients and then performed custom Illumina golden gate assay for 768 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This subset of SNPs was chosen because they were relevant to circadian rhythm regulation. Patients were surveyed about their sleep schedule and habits and polysomnographs were recorded of each patient. Thirty-eight phenotypic measures were analyzed. The authors performed linear or logistic regression analyses and then performed a Bonferroni correction for the total number of SNPs tested. The p-value for this association was 5.3x10-5 prior to Bonferroni correction. Importantly, this SNP is not genome-wide significant.  References: Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP).

Note that a benign variant of this SNP (c.693C>T) also exists as discussed below.Only the A allele at rs12948217 confers risk to Canavan disease. A person with the CC, CT, or TT alleles is not a carrier; someone with the AC or AT alleles is a carrier; and people with two AA alleles are affected with the disease.Note that due for technical reasons, the vast majority of direct-to-consumer companies using DNA chips (microarrays) for genotyping do not distinguish the benign T allele from the pathogenic A allele. As a result, raw data from these companies that reports (A;C) and especially (A;A) is quite likely to actually represent the benign (C;T) or perhaps (T;T) genotypes. This type of error applies only to data derived from microarrays (specifically, Illumina microarrays such as those used by 23andMe and Ancestry) and does not apply to data generated by sequencing.",504
ASPA,Rs28940279,"rs28940279, also known as c.854A>C, E285A or p.Glu285Ala, is a SNP in the ASPA gene.rs28940279 is one of several known causal SNPs of Canavan disease. Canavan disease is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. It is a childhood onset disease which begins in early infancy. It is characterized by disordered muscular behavior (e.g., hypotonia, hyperextension) and neurological symptoms, such as blindness, developmental and cognitive delays. The neurological findings appear to be due to demyelination and leukodystrophy. Histology indicates the presence of spongy degeneration; cytology confirms astrocytic swelling of normal neurons and abnormality of astrocyte mitochondria.  Ultimately, sufferers become extremely ill and die on average at 18 months of age.rs28940279 is a SNP in the aspartoacylase ASPA gene.   The A-C transversion results in a substitution of alanine, a hydrophobic small-chain amino acid, for a glutamate (which is both large and charged). This substitution, E285A, is at a residue predicted to be part of the catalytic domain of aspartocyclase. This missense mutation is predicted to have drastic effects on the catalytic domain because of the vast difference between the amino acids.In particular, this substitution is common in Ashkenazi Jews, with carrier frequency approximately 1 in 60 individuals.  This suggests that some degree of founder effect is responsible for its prevalence within the Ashkenazi Jewish population. In particular, one study suspects that the mutation originated in the Vilna area, in Poland or Lithuania depending on the political timeperiod of origin.  This suggests that it is a newer variant than others found in the more broad European population.",505

In contrast to most BRCA mutations, which are considered tumor suppressors and functionally recessive, this ATM mutation is considered a dominant negative, since loss of the wild-type allele in tumors with the ATM mutation is not consistently observed.Note that the confidence intervals are quite large, so although the relative risk is calculated as increasing eight-fold, the authors cited indicate that they can only state with 95% confidence that the ""true"" increase in relative risk lies somewhere between 2.8 and 22.5.Somewhat similarly, a 2016 publication study involving 42,000 breast cancer cases concluded that rs28904921(G) carriers had an odds ratio of 11 (CI:1.4-85; p=0.0012) and a 52% (CI: 28-80%) chance of developing the disease by age 70.",523

BCHE,Rs1799807,"rs1799807, also known as D70G, is a SNP in the BCHE gene.  This SNP affects the structure, activity, and substrate specificity of the BuChE (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme. Cholinesterases and cholinesterase inhibitors, p. 48 The variant form, rs1799807(G), replaces aspartate with glycine at the secondary substrate/inhibitor binding site.  This single base substitution yields the ""atypical"" version of BChE.  This version has a lower affinity for many substrates, including many Cholinesterase Inhibitors (CIs).  A different cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) is an important component of neurotransmission by acetylcholine (ACh), terminating the action of ACh after it has been released during neurotransmission. BChE is found widely in the plasma and normally binds to CIs, protecting AChE from being inhibited by CIs and so maintaining normal neurotransmission by acetylcholine.Practical consequences of altered substrate affinity from this SNP include:  Succinylcholine, commonly used as an anesthetic, depends on BChE hydrolysis for recovery.  rs1799807(G;G) homozygotes experience a much delayed return to spontaneous breathing following its use.    ""Atypical"" BChE has a low affinity for CI alkaloids naturally occuring in certain plants, particularly those in the nightshade family (potato, tomato, peppers, eggplant, etc.).  rs1799807(G) carriers may be more prone to physiological consequences of AChE inhibition from eating these foods.  Many pesticides are CIs, including organophosphates and carbamates.  rs1799807(G) carriers may have atypical reactions to pesticide residues on foods and in the environment.  Many nerve agents, such as Sarin and VX gas, as well agents used to protect soldiers against them, such as pyridostigmine, are CIs.  rs1799807(G) carriers may be more susceptible to exposure to these agents.  ""Atypical"" BuChE, rs1799807(G), has 30% lower enzymatic activity than the wild-type enzyme.  Homoygous carriers of this polymorphism, rs1799807(G;G), display extreme anxiety after exposure to CIs.    Pseudocholinesterase Deficiency",581

BTBD9,Rs3923809,"This SNP, located in an intron of the BTBD9 gene, has a variant that is seen somewhat more frequently in individuals with restless legs syndrome. The risk allele is rs3923809(A); carriers of two such alleles, i.e. those with rs3923809(A;A) genotypes, are estimated to be 1.9 fold more likely to have restless legs syndrome than rs3923809(G;G) individuals. The authors of this study suggest that perhaps half of the cases of restless legs syndrome may involve the rs3923809 risk genotypes. Consistent with this finding, another report about rs3923809 links the (G) minor allele to a lower frequency of restless legs syndrome with an overall odds ratio of 0.57 (CI: 0.48-0.68). Note that 70-80% of all individuals in European populations carry one or two copies of the (A) major allele, yet restless legs syndrome is thought to affect less than 10% of all adults. Therefore, although an individual may be at higher risk based on their genotype, the genotype by itself certainly isn't able to predictably cause restless legs syndrome.The association between rs3923809 and RLS has been replicated in three European populations, and shows the most consistent effect across populations of several SNPs studied.The results of a 2013 study of Korean patients suggest that the role of BTBD9 in the pathogenesis of restless legs syndrome is more universal across populations than previously reported and more efforts should be focused on the role of epistasis in the genetic architecture of restless legs syndrome.

CACNA1S,Rs2281845,"'''rs2281845''' is a SNP located on chromosome 1q32.1, about 250 bp upstream of the first exon of the CACNA1S (voltage-dependent calcium channel, L type)gene. The linkage disequilibrium block containing rs2281845 extends 22 kb downstream and includes the TMEM9 gene (transmembrane protein 9). This SNP has been clinically  associated with tooth development. The minor allele (T) has specifically been associated with reduced mature dentition between the ages of 6 and 14 in women. In a 2011 report, a genome-wide quantitative trait association study conducted with 521,741 SNPs over 5,097 women from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) found a significant (p-value=1.31E-10) association between the rs2281845 T allele and a reduction in permanent teeth erupted (-0.105) between ages 6 and 14. To confirm this finding, an additional 3,696 individuals were also tested for this association. These subjects were drawn from three additional Danish cohorts, as well as one from the United States. The association was replicated in each of the Danish cohorts (p-values=5.43E-05, 1.09E-04, and 0.012, respectively), but the group from the United States exhibited a weak association (p-value=0.242) in the opposite direction (+0.065 teeth). This contradictory finding was attributed to small sample size and deficiencies in phenotype reporting. The original GWAS and replication datasets, when combined for a total of 8,793 subjects, showed a statistically significant (p-value=8.03E-17) negative association with number of permanent teeth (-0.103). Within the same study, three additional SNPs were identified in the initial DNBC cohort GWAS as having a significant association with number of permanent teeth between ages 6 and 14. These SNPs &#8211; rs12424086, rs4491709, rs7924176 &#8211; were each validated to statistical significance with a replication set (p-values=2.30E-12, 2.16E-14, and 5.64E-19, respectively). No loci aside from those containing these four SNPs exhibited a p-value of less than 5.0E-6. Each of these SNPs that were identified in the context of dental development may be confounded by associations with generalized maturation programs. The authors note that while the phenotype of mature teeth was measured here, the SNPs could in fact correlate better with measures of puberty such as &#8220;skeletal maturation, Tanner score and growth spurt,&#8221; with number of mature teeth simply as a manifestation of these other phenotypes. Mechanistically, rs2281845&#8217;s effect on tooth development may be linked to expression of TMEM9. In a study linking SNPs to gene expression in monocytes, several variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs2281845 were found to be significantly associated with TMEM9 expression. The SNP with highest linkage to rs2281845, rs6667912 (r2=0.42) showed a significant association (p-value=6x10E-29). Little is known regarding the function of TMEM9. It is a well-conserved, 26kDa transmembrane protein with expression throughout a wide variety of human tissues and cells. An &#8216;&#8216;in vitro&#8217;&#8217; study showed localization to the ER, late endosomes, and lysosomes along with  LAMP1 coexpression, but its function within the cell is not yet well-characterized.",862

CACNB2,Rs2799573,"Association between rs2799573 and psychiatric disorders was shown in a 2013 study by the Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium . In this study, genome-wide SNP data consisting of 1,250,922 autosomal SNPs were analyzed to identify genetic variants associated with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. 33,332 cases and 27,888 controls included both unrelated and family-based samples (trios). A multinomial logistic regression procedure was used to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. This SNP, on chromosome 10 in an intron of CACNB2, was one of four genome-wide significant signals associated with the five psychiatric disorders (p = 4.29 x 10-8). The risk allele T exhibited allele frequency of 0.715 in controls. CACNB2 encodes a voltage-gated calcium-channel subunit that interacts with other calcium-channel subunits to facilitate their function and increase peak calcium current. Although CACNB2 had not been previously identified as a risk gene for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, its interactor CACNA1C, was known to be a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder , schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder . Effects of CACNA1C variants on emotion processing circuitry, attention, and memory were demonstrated in fMRI studies . Consistent with this, one of the four significant signals from the 2013 study lies within an intron of CACNA1C. Other peaks identified in this study were rs2535629 and rs11191454.In addition, a variant within CACNB2 52 kb away from rs2799573 was one of the most significant signals in an independent GWAS of bipolar disorder in Han Chinese.

CASP9,Rs1052576,"also known as Q221Rrs1052576 is located on chromosome 1p36.21 in the coding region of CASP9. The CAG to CGG transition results in the allele Q221R. This SNP is associated with ADHD, general cancer risk, multiple myeloma, non-small cell lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma      .Generally the A allele confers protection from a variety of cancers. An intact apoptotic pathway is essential for many cellular processes including development, immune response and prevention of cellular transformation. Caspases are cysteinyl aspartate proteases involved in signal transduction cascades that result in programmed cell death. CASP9 is an initiator caspase and part of the intrinsic pathway, which is an evolutionarily conserved apoptotic pathway. It is responsible for cleaving and activating the executioner caspases CASP3, CASP6, CASP7, leading to nuclear membrane breakdown, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis.In their 2014 study, Lee et al performed an ADHD GWAS meta-analysis to identify casual SNPS in ADHD by focusing on SNPs in coding regions as well as a secondary analysis for pathway enrichement . They identified 11 candidate SNPS, three in the CASP9 gene, rs1052576, rs1052571, rs1820204. This GWAS was performed on a dataset that contained 428,074 SNPS from a publicly available database. This data set is derived from the IMAGE project which comprises of 924 trios of European decent, either an affected child and both parents or an affected child and one sibling and one parent. Patients in this study had to meet stringent criteria as well as live with one biological parent and one full sibling to control for environmental factors. The authors identified SNPS using two approaches. The first approach filtered SNPs by linkage disequilibrium analysis followed by a second approach to  that enriched for SNPs using pathway based analysis algorithm called i-GSEA. The authors used a p<0.05 threshold as well as an FDR cutoff of 0.1 to correct for the multiple testing conditions.  For rs1052576 p=0.042. Odds ratio could not be determined from the data provided in the manuscript. In another recent study, Yan et al performed a meta-analysis of the rs1052576 SNP in CASP-9 . Seven case-control studies with a total of 1668 cancer cases and 2294 healthy controls were analyzed. Six types of cancer were studied: gastric cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, myeloma and liver cancer. Four studies were performed in China, two in the USA and one in Russia. The &#8220;A&#8221; allele carriers of rs1052576 had overall reduced risk for cancer: the ""A"" allele conferred an OR=0.72( 0.58-0.89) p=0.003. However, these data were only statistically significant in Asian populations: rs1052576-A resulted in an OR=0.60 with a 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.81 and a p<0.001, in Asians irrespective of the national origin of the study. Caucasian carriers of rs1052576-A did trend towards a lower OR, however, these data did not reach statistical significance and may warrant further studies: OR=0.85(0.70-1.04), p=0.11. In 2009, Andrew et al identified SNPs to predict bladder cancer susceptibility and survival .  They performed a case-controlled study with 832 bladder cancer cases and 1,191 controls using a population of New Hampshire residents;  95% of this cohort was of Caucasian origin. SNPs that modulated bladder cancer survival were selected using an FDR threshold of <0.5. They found that the rs1052576-G allele reduced survival time for carriers with bladder cancer and increased risk of death due to bladder cancer OR=1.4 (0.8-2.4) and p=0.003. Hosgood, et al performed a population based case control study of 128 cases of women with multiple myeloma and 516 controls all from Connecticut . rs1052576-AG conferred a decreased risk of multiple myeloma OR=0.8 (0.5-1.3) p=0.41, rs1052576-AA OR=0.5 (0.3-0.9)p=0.02,  p=0.02 for the trend. These data need to be considered with care, as the rs1052576-AA odds ratio was the only value that reached near statistical significance on its own. Apoptosis is particularly important in the development of B-lymphocytes. A role for CASP9 in these B-cell lymphomas is likely to be of mechanistic importance. In 2006, Lan et al investigated the effect of SNPs in CASP3 Ex8-280C>A (rs6948) and Ex8+567T>C (rs1049216), CASP8 Ex14-271A>T (rs13113), casp9 Ex5+32G>A (rs1052576) and CASP10 Ex3-171A>G (rs3900115) in the risk of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR. rs1052576-AA genotype had an OR=0.7 (0.5-1.0) p=0.044 for all Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas.  In addition, there were protective effects for the rs1052576-A allele in B-cell lymphomas specifically: rs1052576-AA OR=0.7 (0.5-1.0) p=0.040. The protective effect of the rs1052576-A allele was not statistically significant in T cell lymphomas. This may reflect a small sample size or an inherent difference in the biology of the two cell types. Finally, B-cell lymphomas were further divided into three subtypes: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  The rs1052576-AG conferred an OR=0.6 (0.4-1.0) p=0.039 for follicular lymphoma. It is likely that the rs1052576-AA genotype is protected, however the numbers were small of this genotype and did not reach statistical significance. CASP9 is an important member of the apoptotic pathway and has clear mechanistic importance in the regulation of apoptosis. rs1052576 -G confers an increased risk of cancer in numerous studies. There does seem to be a dose dependent effect, however, this remains to be confirmed with more studies.

CBLB,Rs3087243,"The rs3087243 SNP is also known in the literature as the CT60 G>A or the +6230G>A polymorphism, and it is located in the CTLA4 gene. In Asian (Japanese) populations, the presence of an rs3087243(G) allele represents a 1.3 fold increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease, and for those with autoimmune thyroid disease, a 1.5 fold increased risk of type-1 diabetes. However, in individuals without autoimmune thyroid disease, no association was seen between this SNP and type-1 diabetes. The authors speculate that earlier studies may have reported associations between this SNP and type-1 diabetes that were actually primarily based on the association with autoimmune thyroid disease.This same SNP, rs3087243, has also been implicated as a (minor) risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A study of 2,000+ European RA patients led to a calculated odds ratio of 1.13 (CI: 1.03 - 1.24) for the rs3087243(G) risk allele. In a study of 395 Spanish patients with lupus, rs3087243(G) allele carriers were calculated to have an odds ratio of 1.71 (CI: 1.18-2.49, p=0.003, p(corr) = 0.006).In a different study involving recipients of liver transplants, although also with Spanish patients, the rs3087243(G) allele was significantly associated with acute rejection (odds ratio 1.49, p(corr)=0.038). Patients who lacked this allele had the lowest risk of acute rejection development. Allograft survival data did not show statistical differences between genotypes.  rs2292399 and rs2903692 both significantly associated with type 1 diabetes odds ratio 1.37 and 1.28. A joint analysis revealed that rs3087243, rs2292399, and rs2903692, but not INS rs689, were significant risk factors for the cooccurrence of AITD",908

CD40,Rs4810485,"rs4810485 is a SNP associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. At this locus, the minor allele, T, protects against RA. The SNP is located on chromosome 20q13 in the second intron of the CD40 gene, which encodes a receptor that is expressed on the surface of multiple immune cells. CD40 binds the ligand CD154 which is expressed by activated T cells, and this interaction plays a critical role in T cell helper activity in the immune system. rs4810495 is closely linked with another SNP, rs1883832, that appears to lesson translation of the CD40 gene, affecting this critical signaling pathway that leads to B cell proliferation . Mouse model knockouts of CD40 have been shown to alleviate arthritis . The association between rs4810485 and RA was first identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis and two subsequent replication studies in patients with European ancestry . This study looked at the major allele G versus the minor allele T in a meta-analysis of previous GWAS followed by two replication studies. In the GWAS meta-analysis, which had 3,393 cases and 12,460 controls, they found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2.4x10-7 and an odds ratio of 0.83. Two replication studies looking at 31 loci in combined 3,929 cases and 5,807 controls found the position to be associated with the disease with a p-value of 0.0032 and an odds ratio of 0.91. Jointly, the meta-analysis and replication studies showed an association with a p-value of 8.2x10-9 surpassing a conservative level of significance for joint analysis and an odds ratio of 0.87, suggesting that the minor allele T gives a modest protective effect against RA.The association with RA was confirmed in a targeted validation study in the United Kingdom with 3,962 cases and 3,531 control patients . This study found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2x10-4 and an odds ratio of 0.86. Since this was a targeted study looking at 4 specific loci, the p-value is significant. Again, the odds ratio suggests a modest protective affect for the minor allele T.An additional study looked at this SNP and its association with RA in individuals of Korean ancestry . This study found no association between rs4810485 and RA in patients with Korean ancestry. The targeted validation study looked at 5 SNPs associated with RA in Europeans in 1,113 Korean cases and 988 controls, and found a p-value of 0.39 and an odds ratio of 1.06, suggesting no association between the SNP and RA in Koreans. This case highlights the importance of accounting for ancestry when testing genome-wide associations.",952

CETP,Rs708272,"rs708272, also known as the TaqIB polymorphism of the CETP gene, may influence the levels of the ""good"" cholesterols, the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterols. Generally, the B2 allele is considered to lead to higher HDL levels.However, high HDL cholesterol, at least when combined with another HDL raising SNP (rs1800588), doesn't appear to actually protect individuals from coronary artery disease, at least based on one study of ~800 Caucasian male patients. A similarly confusing picture emerges from a study of two populations of 10,000+ individuals each. The distribution of the CETP genotype was observed to be different in population-based studies compared with studies in populations selected by high cardiovascular risk, and contradictory results were seen when trying to figure out if the TaqIB SNP predicted whether drugs would lower plasma lipids or cardiovascular outcome.A meta-analysis concluded that there probably was a statistically significant, but weak, association for this SNP. For each rs708272(T) allele inherited, individuals had lower mean CETP mass (-9.7%; CI: -11.7% to -7.8%), lower mean CETP activity (-8.6%; CI: -13.0% to -4.1%), higher mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (4.5%; CI: 3.8%-5.2%), and higher mean apolipoprotein A-I concentrations (2.4%; CI, 1.6%-3.2%). The combined per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for coronary disease were 0.95 (CI: 0.92-0.99).A prospective cohort study of 18,245 initially healthy American women over a 10-year period found similar results with respect to HDL-C levels and (inversely) risk of myocardial infarction; rs708272(T) was associated with a per-allele increase in HDL-C levels of 3.1 mg/dL and a concordant 24 percent lower risk of future myocardial infarction (age-adjusted HR 0.76, CI: 0.62-0.94).rs708272 has also been associated with reduced coronary heart disease risk in those drinking alcohol. More specifically, a 2014 study by Mehlig et al., ( studying 618 patients with CHD found that the B2B2 genotype, rs708272(T;T)), had a reduced risk (odds ratio 0.21) for CHD in intermediate vs low drinkers.

CFH,Rs1061170,"rs1061170 is a SNP in the complement factor H CFH gene; it is also known as Tyr402His or p.Y402H. The rs1061170(T) allele encodes the more common Tyr (Y), while the generally rarer rs1061170(C) encodes the His (H).This SNP has been associated primarily with age related macular degeneration, and to a lesser extent, with longevity.This  research paper shows that CFH Y402H is the relevant mutation. A haplotype of rs1061170 rs3753394 rs800292 rs1329428 (TGTC) was found to confer a significantly increased likelihood of exudative AMD. rs1061170 (aka Y402H 1277 T>C) was not associated with exudative AMD.CFH variations appear to contribute to ARMD in Caucasians, but not in Japanese CFH variant rs1061170 Y402H is strongly associated with both dry and wet AMD rs1061170(C) alleles are significantly associated with increased susceptibility to early AMD in Taiwan Chinese populations.Some SNPs in other genes (like C7 and MBL2) may protect individuals with one or two of the rs1061170(C) risk alleles.

The genotype at highest risk is (A;A).Note, most studies have shown that that this SNP is highly predictive (i.e. is in near perfect (D'>0.98) linkage disequilibrium) with rs10490924, thus the status of one very closely predicts the status of the other.  However, one Caucasian AMD study reported the linkage disequilibrium measure for these two SNPs on 10q26, (i.e., rs10490924, which is upstream of HTRA1 in LOC387715/ARMS2, and rs11200638) as D'=0.8, and all four possible haplotypes of the two SNPs were detected in the samples.  Further, this same study reported that these two SNPs appear to contribute equally to the risk of AMD (both GA and CNV) and show no evidence of interaction with CFH .A 2011 meta-analysis concluded that rs11200638(A;G) and (A;A) carriers had 2.243 and 8.669 times the risk of developing AMD, respectively, when compared with those who carry the (G;G) genotype. rs10490924 and rs11200638 defined 2 significant haplotypes associated with increased risk of neovascular AMD. show that rs11200638 has no significant impact on HTRA1 promoter activity in three different cell lines, and HTRA1 mRNA expression exhibits no significant change between control and AMD retinas A study of 95 Taiwanese Chinese confirms rs11200638(A) allele risk for both wet and dry forms of AMD, with heterozygote odds ratio of 1.97 CI:0.81-4.81, homozygote OR = 8.59 CI: 3.28-22.49, p=6.7x10<sup>-3</sup> for an additive allele-dosage model.

CFTR,I4000320,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in populations with European ancestry:  the average carrier frequency is 1:25. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). The CFTR gene encodes a chloride transporter, gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. It regulates the transport of chloride and other ions across the cell membrane. Mutations in CFTR result in raised sweat chloride, respiratory infections, and pancreatic insufficiency.To date, 1939 mutations in the CFTR gene that cause cystic fibrosis have been curated in the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database. Different combinations of mutations in the gene have different effects on its function and thus cause different disease phenotypes. The most common mutation is deltaF508, which is present in about 70% of the cystic fibrosis patients. '''i4000320''', also known as 2789+5G>A and as rs80224560 to the rest of the world (outside of 23andMe), is a rare mutation in the CFTR gene located at position 117242922 of chromosome 7 that causes a mild form of cystic fibrosis . The risk allele is '''i4000320''' (A). Because cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive inherited disease, one needs to carry two defective copies of the CFTR gene to develop the disease. Most commonly, patients harboring the 2789+5G>A variant will be compound heterozygotes carrying other CFTR mutations.Highsmith ''et al'' first identified the '''i4000320''' SNP in 1997  in a study of eight CF patients in a single inbred family. Three of them were homozygous for the '''i4000320''' mutation, and the rest were compound heterozygotes, harboring both the '''i4000320''' and deltaF508 mutations. Sequencing of exon 14b identified a G to A substitution at position +5 of the splice donor site. Such a mutation was predicted to lead to splicing of exon 14a to exon 15, with the deletion of a 38bp exon 14b from the mature CFTR mRNA, resulting in a frameshift mutation and likely in a truncated protein. Southern hybridization and quantitative analyses were performed to determine how abolishing this mutation is for the splicing activity, demonstrating that the patients homozygous for the 14b mutation could produce 4% of the normal CFTR mRNA compared to normal subjects. The patients homozygous for this mutation suffered from a more mild form of cystic fibrosis compared to patients that were compound heterozygous for deltaF508 and 2789+5G>A mutations. In 2008, the truncated version of the CFTR was experimentally identified, further supporting the predicted outcome of the mutation .The first thorough genotype-to-phenotype correlation analysis for '''i4000320''', after the Highsmith ''et al'' study, was published in 2005, in which 34 French patients having the 2789+5G->A/deltaF508 genotype were compared with their matched homozygous deltaF508 patients. The authors reported that the compound heterozygotes had milder disease phenotype: higher frequency of pancreatic sufficiency, better anthropometric and lung function measure, and lower infection susceptibility . In 2006, Mainz, ''et al'', described the case of the oldest living German brothers who are both compound heterozygotes for 2789+5G->A and deltaF508. This study serves as evidence for the association between this particular splicing mutation with the more mild form of cystic fibrosis and thus long term survival .In another study the authors used the database of the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Registry to examine the genotype-phenotype association by looking at the mortality rate of patients homozygous for deltaF508 and the most common compound heterozygous ones. 17853 out of 28455 patients enrolled in the registry were genotyped. Of these, 82 had the 2789+5G->A mutation. They had a significantly lower standardized mortality rate of 4.4 deaths per 1000 person-years (p-value < 0.0001) than those homozygous for deltaF508 (21.8, which was associated with the highest mortality rate .The distribution and frequencies of the CF mutations have been found to be heterogeneous among different ethnic groups. Knowing the precise distribution of the CF mutations, as well as their frequencies, is crucial for genetic counseling and genetic diagnostics. The available data up to date for the 2789+5G->A polymorphism worldwide is summarized in the following table:{| class=""wikitable""|-! Population !! Year the study was published !!

CHRNA3,Rs1051730,"rs1051730, also known as D398N, is a SNP in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 3 subunit CHRNA3 gene.In two recent (2008) studies, together comprising over 6,000 lung cancer patients of European ancestry, the rs1051730(T) allele was very significantly associated with increased risk. Having one copy (i.e. being a rs1051730(C;T) genotype) increased risk for lung cancer about 1.3x, and having two copies (rs1051730(T;T) individuals) represented 1.8x increased risk. Up to 14% of lung cancer incidence may be attributable to this allele.PMID 18385738, PMID 18385676An independent study published at the same time concluded that (T) allele carriers for SNP rs1051730 are not at higher risk of becoming smokers compared to (C) carriers. However, if they do smoke, (T) carriers are quite likely to smoke more cigarettes than (C) carriers, and as an apparent consequence, they are at higher risk for lung cancer as reported in this and other studies. This study therefore links rs1051730 directly to nicotine dependence, and indirectly to lung cancer. According to DeCODE, the CC genotype at rs1051730 is associated with 0.88x risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Note: publications tend to refer to the risk allele as ""A"", however, the orientation reported for rs1051730 in dbSNP is for the opposite strand, so in keeping with reporting all SNPs in the orientation published in dbSNP, SNPedia refers to this same risk allele as the (T) allele. / 23andMe blog (T;T) once more smoke per day. rs1051730 influences how much alcohol it takes to have you feel a buzz.

COL5A1,Rs61735045,"rs61735045, also known as c.1588G>A, p.Gly530Ser and G530S, is a variant in the COL5A1 gene on chromosome 9.Two papers published in 2000 and 2002 proposed that carrying one copy of an rs61735045(A) allele worsened symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome(EDS) in those who had it due to a causative mutation elsewhere, and that carrying two copies would cause EDS. More recent analyses have concluded that the rs61735045(A) allele is quite likely to actually be benign. A 2009 publication found that the frequency of the 530S allele was similar (about 5%) in all groups of people they studied, whether healthy or EDS-affected. Furthermore, the predicted homozygote minor frequency of 1 in 400 people is much higher than that of classical EDS. More recently, ExAC analysis shows an allele frequency of 3.5%, and a minor homozygote frequency of about 1 in 1000, which is still an order of magnitude or more higher than the estimated EDS incidence, incidating that either this allele is benign or the penetrance of even a double mutation is quite low.Additionally, as of 2014, two labs are reporting in ClinVar this variant as benign. In summary, the majority of current evidence indicates that the rs61735045 variant is likely to be benign.",1259

COMT,Rs4680,"rs4680 (Val158Met) is a well studied SNP in the COMT gene. The COMT gene codes for the COMT enzyme, which breaks down dopamine in the brain's prefrontal cortex.  The wild-type allele is a (G), coding for a valine amino acid; the (A) substitution polymorphism changes the amino acid to a methionine.  This alters the structure of the resultant enzyme such that its activity is only 25% of the wild type.  As a result, A allele carriers have more dopamine in their prefrontal cortex, which may be responsible for many of the neuropsychological associations listed below./ 23andMe blog summarizes the alleles at this SNP as rs4680(A) = Worrier. Met, more exploratory, lower COMT enzymatic activity, therefore higher dopamine levels; lower pain threshold, enhanced vulnerability to stress, yet also more efficient at processing information under most conditions rs4680(G) = Warrior. Val, less exploratory, higher COMT enzymatic activity, therefore lower dopamine levels; higher pain threshold, better stress resiliency, albeit with a modest reduction in executive cognition performance under most conditionsRoughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at ) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.Specific studies include:rs4680, a functional Val/Met polymorphism, showed modest association with Irish familial schizophrenia. Haplotype A-G-A for SNPs rs737865-rs4680-rs165599 was preferentially transmitted to the affected subjects.A study of 400 individuals reported that an increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) of 10.4% (CI: 0.01-0.21, p=0.03) for associated with rs4680(A;A) homozygotes compared with rs4680(G;G) subjects.

A study of the antidepressant paroxetine found better response in Met/Met homozygotes, worse effects in Val/Val homozygotes and intermediate effects in heterozygotes. The effect became significant at the third week of treatment. Paroxetine daily dose was proportional to baseline severity, but did not influence outcome./ g2b2mh (A;A) subjects deploy more attentional focus when they realize they have made an error.A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies found a significant association between the COMT genotype and prefrontal activation; strong and opposing effects were found for executive cognition paradigms (favoring Met allele carriers) and emotional paradigms (favoring Val). gray matter volume and interacts with rs2097603 related to extracellular dopamine rs6275/DRD2 and rs4680/COMT useful in predicting disease risk among schizophrenia patients rs4680(G;G) carriers deprived of sleep respond quite well to 2x 100mg modafinil in terms of improved vigor and well-being, and maintained baseline performance with respect to executive functioning, whereas rs4680(A;A) individuals barely responded to the drug at all. Met158 allele carriers had ""a more focused response...during a working memory task."" ""The met158 allele seems to be beneficial during the performance of working memory and attention-related tasks, whereas the val158 allele appears to be advantageous during the processing of aversive emotional stimuli."" ""Increased limbic and prefrontal activation elicited by unpleasant stimuli in subjects with more met158 alleles might contribute to the observed lower emotional resilience against negative mood states."" In response to pain Met/Met allele carriers showed greater ""sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in val158 homozygotes.

CTLA4,Rs231775,"rs231775, also known as +49A>G (or CTLA-4 A49G), is a polymorphism of the CTLA4 gene. Polymorphisms are associated with several autoimmune diseases, especially autoimmune thyroiditis, as well as several other disorders.   A 2017 study titled ""CD28/CTLA-4/ICOS haplotypes confers susceptibility to Graves’ disease and modulates clinical phenotype of disease"" found that rs5742909 CC and rs231775 G allele ""were associated with the family burden of GD"" (Graves' disease, a form of Autoimmune thyroiditis).  The G allele at rs231775 did not affect risk for Graves' Orbitopathy (GO), but favored severe disease outcome for GO. The presence of the A allele ""was significantly associated with sporadic GD."" A 2016 study titled ""Association of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4 (CTLA4) Gene Polymorphisms with Autoimmune Thyroid Disease in Children and Adults: Case-Control Study"" found that in a Han Chinese population, rs231775 ""Genotype G/G conferred a risk of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.20–2.02; Pc = 0.002) for GD (Graves' disease) in adults and of 1.56 (95% CI, 1.19–2.05; Pc = 0.002) in children. Allele G was significantly associated with GD (Graves' disease) in adults (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.21–1.84; Pc < 0.001) and in children (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.15–1.77; Pc = 0.002)."" A 2016 study titled ""Association of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) and Thyroglobulin (TG) Genetic Variants with Autoimmune Hypothyroidism"" sampled 84 hypothyroidism patients and 62 controls from Gujarat, India. Researchers found that CTLA4 Exon1 (+49A/G) rs231775 polymorphisms increased the odds of autoimmune hypothyroidism in their sample: Odds ratios were   for AA, 1.0 (Genotypes were similar between patients and controls)  for AG, 5.333 (95%CI 2.043 to 13.92, p=0.0004) compared to AA  for GG, 5.778  (95%CI 1.829 to 18.25, p=0.0004) compared to AAThey also discovered that polymorphisms of rs231775 were associated with significantly decreased mRNA expression of both full length (flCTLA4) and soluble (sCTLA4) transcripts.   AA genotypes were similar between patients and controls.  AG decreased expression of both significantly (by p = 0.0141 for flCTLA4, and by p = 0.0358 for sCTLA4) in patients compared to controls  GG decreased expression levels slightly (by p = 0.0007 for flCTLA4, and by p = 0.0102 for sCTLA4) in patients compared to controlsThey also found significant differences in patients vs. controls when analyzing the TG exon 33 SNP rs2076740. A 2014 study titled ""The association of PTPN22 rs2476601 polymorphism and CTLA-4 rs231775 polymorphism with LADA  risks: a systematic review and meta-analysis"" examined Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) and found that ""The minor T allele at rs2476601 and the minor G at rs231775 carried estimated relative risks (odds ratio) of 1.52 (95 % CI 1.29–1.79) and 1.39 (95 % CI 1.11–1.74), respectively. These alleles contributed to an absolute lowering of the risk of all LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults) by 4.88 and 14.93 % when individuals do not carry these alleles."" Researchers stated that ""LADA accounts for 2–12 % of all cases of diabetes"" but ""The progression to insulin dependence in LADA patients is believed more rapidly than classic type 2 diabetes patients"" and ""8–10 % of patients diagnosed with T2D are in fact misdiagnosed LADA.""  A 2015 study titled ""Association between CTLA-4 rs231775 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility"" revealed that ""The frequencies of genotype AA and allele A in CTLA-4 rs231775 polymorphism were significantly higher in cases"" of liver cancer than the control group (AA vs. GG: OR=2.81, P=0.043; A vs. G: OR=1.63, P=0.022). Meanwhile, the genetic expression level of CTLA-4 was remarkably higher in cases compared with the controls. The association analysis indicated that AA genotype carriers exhibited highest level of CTLA-4 (P<0.01).""   A 2015 study titled ""Associations between CTLA-4 +49 A/G (rs231775) polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis based on 52 case-control studies"" stated ""This meta-analysis suggests that the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism may be a protective factor for cancer.""  The minor G allele decreased cancer risk overall and for a large number of cancer types, ""especially for breast cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers, epithelial tumor, respiratory system cancer, reproductive and breast cancer, malignant bone tumor,"" ""but not digestive system cancer, hematopoietic malignancy and skin cancer."" Most of the decreased cancer risk was in Asian populations. Table 3 data demonstrated ""association between the risk of cancer and the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism (GG+AG vs. AA)."" Although most of the Asian data showed ""decreased risk,"" a few studies showed extreme increased risk, and these data skewed the average OD. On average, the data showed 0.85 OD of decreased cancer risk overall (0.98 for Caucasians and 0.76 for Asians). In this 2008 article, researchers reported that ""One of the best demonstrations of the power of subset analysis is the CTLA-4 gene in T1D. Although CTLA-4 showed very weak association with T1D, when analyzed in the subset of patients with both T1D and AITD, the genetic effect of CTLA-4 was significantly stronger."" Note: rs231775 is one SNP within the CTLA-4 gene.. Published 2012.

CTLA4,Rs3087243,"The rs3087243 SNP is also known in the literature as the CT60 G>A or the +6230G>A polymorphism, and it is located in the CTLA4 gene. In Asian (Japanese) populations, the presence of an rs3087243(G) allele represents a 1.3 fold increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease, and for those with autoimmune thyroid disease, a 1.5 fold increased risk of type-1 diabetes. However, in individuals without autoimmune thyroid disease, no association was seen between this SNP and type-1 diabetes. The authors speculate that earlier studies may have reported associations between this SNP and type-1 diabetes that were actually primarily based on the association with autoimmune thyroid disease.This same SNP, rs3087243, has also been implicated as a (minor) risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A study of 2,000+ European RA patients led to a calculated odds ratio of 1.13 (CI: 1.03 - 1.24) for the rs3087243(G) risk allele. In a study of 395 Spanish patients with lupus, rs3087243(G) allele carriers were calculated to have an odds ratio of 1.71 (CI: 1.18-2.49, p=0.003, p(corr) = 0.006).In a different study involving recipients of liver transplants, although also with Spanish patients, the rs3087243(G) allele was significantly associated with acute rejection (odds ratio 1.49, p(corr)=0.038). Patients who lacked this allele had the lowest risk of acute rejection development. Allograft survival data did not show statistical differences between genotypes.  rs2292399 and rs2903692 both significantly associated with type 1 diabetes odds ratio 1.37 and 1.28.

CYP1A2,Rs762551,"rs762551, also known as -164A>C or -163C>A, is a SNP encoding the CYP1A2 1F allele of the CYP1A2 gene. CYP1A2 is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of caffeine and some drugs.The baseline activity of the enzyme is similar in CYP1A2 1F allele carriers and non-carriers. However, rs762551(A) codes for the ""high inducibility"" form of the enzyme, characterized by higher enzyme activity in the presence of an inducer such as smoking or heavy coffee consumption . In non-smokers, there was no significant difference in CYP1A2 activity between the genotypes. In smokers, however, the A/A homozygotes had 1.6x higher CYP1A2 activity than A/C and C/C genotypes . Similarly, among non-smokers, only in heavy coffee consumers (more than 3 cups daily) the A/A homozygotes had about 1.4x higher CYP1A2 activity. There was no differences in CYP1A2 activity by genotype in non-heavy coffee consumers. A study of healthy premenopausal non-hormone using women concluded that drinkers of 3 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have lower breast volume (smaller breasts), but only if they had at least one rs762551(C) allele (p(interaction)=0.02), which was said to be consistent with reports that coffee protects only C-allele carriers against breast cancer.Another study by this same group looked at coffee consumption as related to breast cancer. Among 458 such patients (age 25-99 years), rs762551(A;A) women (about 1/2 of the total study) who drank 2 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have a later age at diagnosis compared with low coffee consumption (59.8 versus 52.6 years, p = 0.0004). These patients were also more likely to have ER- tumors than patients with low consumption (14.7% versus 0%, p = 0.018). Coffee consumption had no associations in carriers of a rs762551(C) allele.An independent study of 411 BRCA1 mutation carriers (170 cases and 241 controls) looked at the association between breast cancer, coffee consumption before age 35, and CYP1A2 genotype. While CYP1A2 genotype did not affect breast cancer risk, women with at least one rs762551(C) allele who consumed coffee had a 64% reduction in breast cancer risk, compared with women who never consumed coffee (odds ratio 0.36, CI: 0.18-0.73). No such protective effect was seen in rs762551(A;A) women.A study of 2,000 Costa Ricans who survived a first heart attack observed a general trend between coffee consumption and increased risk among carriers of rs762551(C) alleles, i.e. more coffee led to increased nonfatal heart attack risk. No association was seen for rs762551(A;A) individuals.",1388

CYP1B1,Rs9282671,"rs9282671, also known as c.241T>A, p.Tyr81Asn and Y81N, is a variant in the CYP1B1 gene on chromosome 2.The minor allele for this variant, rs9282671(A), was originally reported in 2004 as being an autosomal dominant mutation associated with adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Note that POAG is typically considered a disorder that is recessively inherited, and that the age of onset is known to be quite variable even for a given single mutation.A functional study in 2008 concluded that this mutation (the Y81N variant) should be considered a hypomorphic allele rather than a mutation, since the enzymatic activity of corresponding protein was in between that of a classic CYP1B1 mutant and that of a normal protein.More recently, the variant has been categorized as benign in ClinVar. In ExAC, it is clearly a rare variant, with an average minor allele frequency of 0.006, but showing the highest frequency in Finnish European populations (0.04).Overall, the significance of this variant is unclear. A person carrying one or more minor rs9282671 alleles may wish to bring this to the attention of relevant health-care providers, but it could well be medically unimportant.",1393

CYP21A2,Rs6467,"Note that this SNP is unusual in at least two regards. First, it is defined in both dbSNP and here in SNPedia (currently at least) as being on the minus strand, even though the vast majority of its fellow CYP21A2 gene SNPs are defined on the plus strand. The literature and most (other) databases define this SNP based on the plus strand.Second, there are three alleles for this SNP; as defined on the minus strand, there are plenty of individuals walking around with rs6467(G) and rs6467(T) alleles, both of which lead to fully functional 21-hydroxylase (the enzyme encoded by the CYP21A2 gene), and there are also some individuals carrying a rs6467(C) allele, which severely reduces enzyme activity.The rs6467(T) polymorphism defines the CYP21A2 1B allele according to the  CYP21A2 Nomenclature table.

A study of 1,000+ breast cancer patients showed a 0.77x decreased risk of breast cancer for carriers of a CYP2C19 17 allele (CI: 0.65-0.93, p = 0.005). Analysis of a subgroup of such carriers who were using hormone therapy for ten years or longer showed an even stronger effect (odds ratio 0.57, CI: 0.39-0.83, p = 0.003).

CYP2C19,Rs4244285,"rs4244285 is a SNP in the CYP2C19 gene, potentially encoding the CYP2C19 2 variant. This variant is the most common reason for poor metabolism of compounds like mephenytoin (an anti-convulsant), some antidepressants, the anti-platelet drug Plavix, and some drugs used for ulcer conditions of various types. The risk allele is rs4244285(A).As a nonfunctioning CYP2C19, this variant would be expected to be a poor metabolizer of several commonly prescribed drugs, including anti-ulcer drugs like omeprazole (trade names Losec and Prilosec), esomeprazole (trade name Nexium), and lansoprazole (trade name Prevacid).In Caucasians, SNPs in CYP2C19 are relatively rare (in contrast to SNPs in CYP2D6), but SNPs in this gene are common in Asians. Ulcer treatment with omeprazole to reduce Helicobacter pylori has been shown to vary depending on a patient's CYP2C19 genotype, varying from 28% in patients homozygous for CYP2C19 alleles encoding fully functional proteins to 100% in patients with variations leading to poor metabolism. The fact that poor metabolizers for many cytochrome p450s achieve higher therapeutic success for some drugs is speculated to be because for some of the drug being broken down (ie metabolized) slower, the effective concentrations are both higher and longer lasting. However, other drugs clearly work less well in carriers of reduced function CYP2C19 alleles. An example of such a drug is clopidogrel, sold under the brand name Plavix. This has now (2010) been acknowledged by the FDA, who have added a boxed warning to Plavix, alerting patients and health care professionals that the drug can be less effective in people who have CYP2C19 variants and cannot convert the drug as effectively to its active form. recent (December 2008) studies reach similar (though not identical) conclusions about the consequences of CYP2C19 2 allele carriers prescribed clopidogrel to reduce their cardiovascular risk:  A study of 245 French patients under 45 years of age prescribed clopidogrel after surviving a first heart attack concluded that rs4244285(A) allele carriers were at 4x higher risk (CI: 1&#183;81&#8212;9&#183;02, p=0&#183;0006) for subsequent adverse cardiovascular events compared to noncarriers.  A study of 2,208 French patients prescribed clopidogrel, of which 225 subsequently died and 94 had a nonfatal heart attack or stroke, came to two conclusions :   Patients carrying any two CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles ( 2,  3,  4, or  5), had about a 2x increased risk (21.5% vs. 13.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.98; CI: 1.10-3.58) for adverse cardiovascular events than CYP2C19 1 homozygotes.   Among the 1,535 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty) during hospitalization, patients with two CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles were at even higher risk for adverse events: 3.58x (CI: 1.71-7.51) compared to CYP2C19 1 homozygotes.  A study of 1,477 subjects with acute coronary syndromes who were treated with clopidogrel as part of the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TRITON-TIMI) 38 study concluded that rs4244285(A) allele carriers had a 1.53x increased risk for death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke, as compared with noncarriers (12.1% vs. 8.0%; CI: 1.07-2.19, p=0.01) and were at 3x higher risk of stent thrombosis (2.6% vs. 0.8%; CI: 1.19-8.00, p=0.02).   CYP2C19 2 loss-of-function genotypes were associated with diminished platelet response to clopidogrel treatment and poorer cardiovascular outcomes in a study of 429 healthy Amish individuals treated for 7 days (in the first study) and 227 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty) (in the second study).

CYP2C9,Rs1799853,"rs1799853 is a SNP in the CYP2C9 gene and is linked to poor warfarin metabolism and risk of GI bleeding with some NSAID drugs. The common nomenclature for this polymorphism is CYP2C9 2 (Cys amino acid, T allele; the SNP is also known as C430T or Cys144Arg). Advanced knowledge of this may influence initial warfarin dosing by physicians. Warfarin is monitored through INR (international normalized ratio) and proper dosing is influenced by a variety of factors including warfarin metabolism and diet.  The rs1799853(T) allele encodes a variant amino acid, cysteine, which has been linked to poor metabolism of warfarin and thus sensitivity. The CYP2C9 2 allele is also associated with higher sensitivity to the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin. Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) mention concurrent testing for the HLA-B 15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN). The effect of CYP2C9 variants on drug metabolism should not be predicted without also considering CYP2C9 3, defined as the common loss of function variant rs1057910(C)  (NM_000771:c.430C>T, NP_000762:p.144R>C) /. In a 2009 article titled ""Genetically based impairment in CYP2C8- and CYP2C9-dependent NSAID metabolism as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding: is a combination of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics required to improve personalized medicine?"" Authors reviewed prior research that argued: Individuals carrying minor alleles of this both CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 AND CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) have increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib.  In addition, carriers of the risk allele for CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 have decreased metabolism of Ibuprofen, Flurbiprofen, Piroxicam, and Tenoxicam.   The presence of CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 allele alone does not confer risk with Diclofenac, but when it is combined with CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080), Diclofenac induces hepatoxicity and confers risk of GI bleeding.    In a 2008 article (reviewed in ) titled ""Interaction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes modifies the risk for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related acute gastrointestinal bleeding,"" the study discovered that carriers of CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a GI bleeding event risk OR=1.81 (95% CI=0.95–3.46; P=0.071) and risk increased if carriers drank more than 20g alcohol/day to an OR=1.99 (95% CI=1.06–3.74; P=0.034). As CYP2C8 3 and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium, patients are likely to carry the risk allele to both 8 3 and 9 2, and when they do, The OR (95% CI) for carriers of such a genotype is increased to 1.94 (1.13–3.33), P=0.017.   A 2013 NIH review titled ""PharmGKB summary: very important pharmacogene information for cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8"" reiterated that ""some data suggest that the combined presence of minor risk alleles CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080) and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 is a determinant of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding.""

CYP2D6,Rs1065852,"Also known as c.100C>T (p.Pro34Ser or P34S), the wild type (normal) allele at this SNP is (C). The (T) variant indicates the presence of a non-wild type CYP2D6 variant, but it appears in many different variants so it can not be used to determine the presence of any particular variant. The most common variants it appears in are CYP2D6 10 and CYP2D6 4, but these are not the only ones. While this is the defining mutation for CYP2D6 10, it is not possible by itself for this mutation to determine a particular variant. In addition, the CYP2D6 4 variant includes this mutation, but the defining mutation 1846G>A SNP is not available in the common direct to consumer testing services.While it is not possible for this mutation to identify one particular variant, all the variants in which it appears have reduced or no CYP2D6 activity.If two copies of this (or similar) changes are inherited, poor metabolism ('PM') of debrisoquine  is observed. Other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 include dextromorphan, sparteine, nortriptyline, atomoxetine , and codeine.Nakamura et al  suggest that thermal instabilities and reduced intrinsic clearance by the protein encoded by the rs1065852(T) allele are the main reasons Asians show lower metabolic activities than Caucasians for drugs metabolized mainly by CYP2D6, since this (T) allele occurs in higher frequency in Asians.A study of several hundred Chinese breast cancer patients treated with either tamoxifen or toremifene reported that for the 50 women who were CYP2D6 10 homozygotes (i.e. rs1065852(T;T)), the group treated with toremifene had a significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate than the group treated with tamoxifen (90.9% vs. 67.9%, p = 0.031). For the remaining rs1065852 (C;C) and (C;T) patients, there was no significant difference between the 5-year DFS rates of those treated with one drug versus the other.It is also suggested that poor metabolizers of debrisoquine will be poor metabolizers of metoprolol, diltiazem (brand name cardizem), and propafenone.

CYP2D6,Rs3892097,"Also known as c.506-1G>A or 1846G>A, the normal (or wild type) form of this SNP is a (G) as defined on the reverse/minus strand. The (A) form disrupts proper mRNA formation, resulting in a nonfunctional CYP2D6 protein. The associated allele is also known as CYP2D6 4. The CYP2D6 4 allele is the most common nonfunctioning variant of CYP2D6.If two copies of this (or similar) changes are inherited, poor metabolism ('PM') of debrisoquine  is observed. Many other drugs are typically first metabolized by CYP2D6 including dextromorphan, sparteine, metoprolol, nortriptyline and many other antidepressants and codeine. Of course, sometimes the active form of a drug is the one post-CYP2D6 metabolism; an example of this is tamoxifen, where the active form (endoxifen) is formed primarily via CYP2D6 metabolism; less functioning CYP2D6 can mean less benefit from taking the drug.The CYP2D6 4 allele (i.e. rs3892097(A)) has been postulated by researchers over the years to have many potential consequences, both positive and negative.On the positive side: this allele may reduce the risk of certain cancers, such as bladder and lung , and it may correlate with somwhat less severe neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's .On the other hand, at least two studies PMID 14991823, PMID 15174030 have concluded that the risk of developing Parkinson's disease upon exposure to pesticides is increased from 3 to 8 fold among carriers of CYP2D6 4 alleles. The risk to CYP2D6 4 carriers appears proportional to the degree of pesticide exposure, with no additional risk of developing Parkinson's seen for CYP2D6 4 carriers with no pesticide exposure, and the highest increased risk of developing Parkinson's seen for CYP2D6 4 carriers with frequent exposure to pesticides.Patients prescribed tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) who are homozygous for the CYP2D6 4 allele metabolize these drugs more slowly, which puts them at higher risk for adverse side effects. A study of ~1100 Dutch patients reports: (1) 6 fold more side effects upon switching antidepressants for CYP2D6 4 homozygotes, but not for heterozygotes, and (2) that the effective and maintenance doses of antidepressants for CYP2D6 4 homozygotes are lower than for patients with one or more higher metabolizing CYP2D6 alleles. rs3892097(A;A) patients taking a beta blocker drug such as metoprolol are at ~4x increased risk for bradycardia, based on a study of 1,533 patients in the Rotterdam Study. These CYP2D6  4/ 4 homozygotes have the 'poor metabolizer' (PM) phenotypes, and had adjusted heart rates that were 8.5 beats/min lower compared with  1/ 1 extensive metabolizers (EMs) (p < 0.001), leading to an increased risk of bradycardia in PMs (odds ratio of 3.86, CI: 1.68-8.86,  p = 0.0014).",1484

Personality disorder patients carrying the DBH TT genotype exhibited higher neuroticism and novelty seeking scores as compared to individuals with the (C;C) or (C;T) genotype. Analyses on the level of the neuroticism and novelty seeking subscales revealed that the DBH (T;T) genotype was primarily associated with personality features related to impulsiveness and aggressive hostility. Also adult ADHD patients carrying the homozygous (T;T) genotypes displayed by significantly increased neuroticism scores; when both personality disorder and adult ADHD patient were analyzed together, (T;T) carriers also displayed by significantly lower conscientiousness levels.

DHFR,Rs70991108,"rs70991108 is a polymorphism consisting of a 19-bp deletion in the first intron of the dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene. The wild-type (non-deletion) allele is a bit more common than the deletion allele in most populations. Several studies have linked this SNP to alterations in folic acid (and folate) metabolism. A study of 1,215 subjects  from the Framingham Offspring Study concluded that rs70991108 influences the prevalence of circulating folic acid levels. Specifically, folic acid intake over 500ug/d led to high circulating (unmetabolized) folic acid levels in subjects homozygous for the deletion genotype. When folic acid intake was under 250ug/d, the deletion/deletion homozygotes had lower RBC folate (732.2 nmol/L) compared with the non-deletion genotype (844.4 nmol/L). A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs70991108 deletion allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~4.6x for heterozygous and homozygous rs70991108 deletion genotypes, respectively (p=0.05). If a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele was also a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).Studies have also looked for connections between this SNP and the risk of having a baby born with spina bifida, but the results are inconsistent between studies:  PMID 14735580, PMID 15755837: suggested the del/del genotype increased risk for spina bifida and pre-term delivery  : suggested that the del/del genotype actually reduced risk for spina bifida  : found no connection whatsoever between the del/del genotype and spina bifida risk",1606

DIO2,Rs12885300,". Published 2009. This study analyzed polymorphisms of SNPs rs12885300 (called ""(ORFa)-Gly3Asp"") and rs225014 (called ""Thr92Ala"") in relation to DIO2 gene activity in BPAD (Bipolar disorder) patients in China. Findings in abstract: ""Both SNPs were significantly higher in the BPAD patients, with odds ratios of 1.489 ... and 1.616 ... respectively. Individuals with two copies of the variant 3Gly or 92Ala were at greater risk of BPAD.... Haplotypes ORFa-3Asp-92Ala and ORFa-3Gly-92Ala indicated higher susceptibility for BPAD with odds ratios of 3.759 (95% CI=2.013-7.020) and 1.292 (95% CI=1.017-1.642), respectively, while ORFa-3Asp-92Thr probably played a protective role with an odds ratio of 0.395 (95% CI=0.284-0.549)."" (Abstract). A 2008 article titled ""Identification of DIO2 as a new susceptibility locus for symptomatic osteoarthritis"" explained that ""Confirmation and replication by association in the additional osteoarthritis studies indicated a common DIO2 haplotype, exclusively containing the minor allele of rs225014 and common allele of rs12885300, with a combined recessive odds ratio of 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-2.34 with P = 2.02 x 10(-5) in female cases with advanced/symptomatic hip osteoarthritis."" (Abstract). This 2011 study examined various shapes of hip joints in relation to osteoarthritis (OA) risk alleles. They ""observed a significant interaction between carrier status of DIO2 rs12885300 and hip OA characteristics for mode 1 (shown in Figure 1) (P = 0.005). ... This specific aspect of hip shape correlates with OA characteristics only in carriers of the susceptibility allele."" (Abstract) The -258A/G (SNP rs12885300) polymorphism of the human type 2 deiodinase gene is associated with a shift in the pattern of secretion of thyroid hormones following a TRH-induced acute rise in TSH.. After thyroidectomy, high doses of L-T4 are used to suppress TSH. Since no T3 is being produced by the thyroid, the body depends on D1 and D2 enzymes to convert T4 into the active T3. This study collected 1905 serum samples from 151 patients over 8.8 to 11.5 years and analyzed four SNPs: DIO1-rs11206244 (D1-C785T) DIO1-rs12095080 (D1-A1814G)  DIO2-rs225014 (D2-Thr92Ala) DIO2-rs12885300 (D2-ORFa-Gly3Asp). Their data ""suggest that the negative feedback of FT(4) on TSH is weaker in patients homozygous for the D2-rs12885300 T allele than in wild-type and heterozygous subjects."" These patients ""have an altered set point of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis."" However, they noted that their data depended on TSH and T4 levels alone, since T3 and rT3 were measured at only one time point during the study. A common variation in deiodinase 1 gene DIO1 is associated with the relative levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine. (Published 2008). Attempted to study rs12885300 but this SNP failed quality control due to duplicate errors and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The study found significant effects with variants of another DIO1 SNP, rs2235544.See further discussion of this DIO2 gene's other SNP : rs225014",1613
DIO2,Rs225014,"rs225014, also known as Thr92Ala, represents a variant in the deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II DIO2 gene on chromosome 14. In dbSNP orientation for this SNP, the more common (T) allele encodes the Thr (threonine) and the somewhat less common (C) allele encodes the Ala (alanine) at this position in the DIO2 protein.Polymorphisms in this SNP have associations with various conditions in the literature: osteoarthritis, psychological disorders, reduced thyroid hormone metabolism, Type 2 diabetes, and various other conditions.==Osteoarthritis== A 2012 article titled ""Increased type II deiodinase protein in OA-affected cartilage and allelic imbalance of OA risk polymorphism rs225014 at DIO2 in human OA joint tissues"" identified that the minor 'C' allele was associated with a significant, 1.3-fold higher risk of osteoarthritis (OA) relative to the 'T' allele. A 2008 article titled ""Identification of DIO2 as a new susceptibility locus for symptomatic osteoarthritis"" explained that ""Confirmation and replication by association in the additional osteoarthritis studies indicated a common DIO2 haplotype, exclusively containing the minor allele of rs225014 and common allele of rs12885300, with a combined recessive odds ratio of 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-2.34 with P = 2.02 x 10(-5) in female cases with advanced/symptomatic hip osteoarthritis."" (Abstract)==Psychological disorders==. Published 2015. Abstract stated ""The specific variant of the DIO2 gene, namely the CC genotype of the Thr92Ala polymorphism, was more frequently found in healthy subjects than in patients with depression, what suggests that it could potentially serve as a marker of a lower risk for recurrent depressive disorder. The distribution of four haplotypes was also significantly different between the two study groups with the TC (Thr-Gly) haplotype more frequently detected in patients with depression."" (Abstract). Published 2009. This study analyzed ""(ORFa)-Gly3Asp (rs12885300) and Thr92Ala (rs225014) with potential functions on the activity of DIO2.""

(Abstract)==Thyroid hormone metabolism and treatment for hypothyroidism==. According to a 2009 study of 500 patients, hypothyroid patients on LT4 (Levothyroxine) therapy who don't show much improvement may have lower brain thyroid levels (not reflected in their serum levels) correlated to the number of rs225014(C) alleles they carry, and these patients may benefit from combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy.  ""The Thr92AlaD2 Polymorphism May Play a Novel Role in Hypothyroidism"" by Elizabeth A McAninch, Antonio C Bianco, US Endocrinology, 2015;11(2):92–4 DOI: . This article stated ""A prevalent polymorphism in D2, Thr92AlaD2, has been associated with improved well-being on “combination therapy” with T4+T3; the underlying mechanism is unclear as T4-to-T3 conversion appears normal. Novel studies indicate this might be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. If the relationship between Thr92AlaD2-expression and treatment preference is confirmed, personalized medicine may play a role in hypothyroidism."" (Abstract)However, as of 2016, controversy continued about the value of testing for and treating polymorphisms of this SNP.  See the liothyronine page for further references.==Type 2 Diabetes==.

DRD2,Rs1800497,"rs1800497, a SNP also known as the TaqIA (or Taq1A) polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor DRD2 gene (even though it is actually located over 10,000bp downstream of the gene), gives rise to the DRD2 A1 allele, whereas rs1800497(C) gives rise to the DRD2 A2 allele. The minor allele (i.e. A1, rs1800497(T)) is associated with a reduced number of dopamine binding sites in the brain , and it has been postulated to play a role in alcoholism, smoking, and certain neuropsychiatric disorders.The reduced number of dopamine binding sites may play a role in nicotine addiction by causing an ""understimulated"" state that can be relieved by smoking (and/or use of other drugs). It may also be associated with reduced response to errors and increased addictive behavior.A wide variety of reports have been published over more than ten years either linking rs1800497 to aspects of nicotine use and smoking cessation success, or finding no such association. A meta-analysis of 41 such studies published in 2004 concluded that overall the association of rs1800497 with such phenomena was statistically weak.  This same group published (in 2009) a study showing no association between rs1800497 and improved response to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), contrary to their previous study.More recently, a relatively large study of over 700 patients attempting to kick their smoking habit using the drug bupropion determined that smokers homozygous for the A2/A2 genotype were more successful than A1/A2 or A1/A1 individuals. The A2/A2 smokers were more than three times as likely, relative to placebo, to be abstinent at end of treatment (35.2% vs. 15.1%; odds ratio = 3.25, CI: 2.00-5.28) and at 6 months of follow-up (26.7% vs. 12.2%; odds ratio = 2.81, CI: 1.66-4.77), whereas not so much by 12 months (16.3% vs. 10.7%; OR = 1.70, CI: 0.95-3.05). Basically, A1/A2 and A1/A1 genotype smokers didn't gain anything from using bupropion versus placebo; bupropion only helped A2/A2 genotypes stop smoking. In a study of individuals in the Polyp Prevention Trial with any, multiple (>/=2) or advanced colorectal adenoma recurrence after 4 years, compared to those without adenoma recurrence, rs1800497(T;T) individuals were significantly associated with all advanced adenoma recurrence (odds ratio 2.40, CI: 1.11-5.20).  The authors speculate this increased risk of adenoma recurrence (and an association with colorectal cancer) may be related to SNP-associated differences in alcohol and fat intake.A 2014 preliminary study links an individual's ANKK1 rs1800497 genotype as likely to experience greater positive subjective effects following cocaine exposure, including greater 'high' and 'like', and these individuals may have increased vulnerability to continue using cocaine or they may be at greater risk to relapse during periods of abstinence. The study states that replication of these findings is necessary to confirm these findings.SNPs rs6276, rs6277, and rs1800497) in the human DRD2 gene are associated with decreased D2R expression and function, as well as high blood pressure.  Data supports the hypothesis that D2R function has protective effects in human renal proximal tubule cells hRPTCs and suggest that carriers of these SNPs may be prone to chronic renal disease and high blood pressure.  SNPs, rs1800497 and rs2283265, located near and within the dopamine receptor 2 DRD2 gene, respectively, were significantly associated with improvements during working memory training (p < .003 and p < .0004, respectively).

DRD2,Rs1801028,"rs1801028 is a SNP in the dopamine D2 receptor DRD2 gene. A meta-analysis comprising 27 samples and over 3,707 schizophrenia patients concluded that Cys/Ser heterozygotes, i.e. rs1801028(C;G) genotypes, were at elevated risk for schizophrenia when compared to either homozygote genotype (rs1801028(C;C) or rs1801028(G;G)). The odds ratio was 1.4 (p<0.005). An earlier meta-analysis comprising over 9,000 schizophrenia patients concluded pretty much the same thing: the Cys311 (rs1801028(G)) allele frequency led to an odds ratio of 1.43 (CI: 1.16-1.78, p<0.001) for this risk allele. A study of ~120 Chinese patients with schizophrenia concluded that Cys/Ser heterozygotes may not respond to risperidone treatment as well as Ser/Ser homozygotes.A paper has been published describing mistakes made in assigning allele status for this SNP:  (free full text) Misassigned alleles can annihilate efforts to control quality in otherwise well-designed genetic association analyses. To date, the issue remains underreported, as is exemplified by studies of a diallelic DRD2 missense variant in schizophrenia. For this variant, allele frequency data have been either misassigned, or incorrectly cited on four consecutive occasions. Contrary to conjecture, low heterozygosity has not guarded against the error with regard to rs1801028, a SNP that features a canonical base pair transversion, G:C.In the case of rs1801028, rs1801028(C) is the more common allele, encoding the amino acid Serine at position 311, whereas rs1801028(G) encodes Cysteine.",1683

From a pooled meta-study (total of 4 other reports plus this one) the allelic odds ratio is 1.42 (CI: 1.26-1.61, p<0.00005), and the genotypic odds ratio for the (C;C) genotype was 1.6 (CI: 1.32-1.95, p<0.00005).Note that rs6275 and rs6277 are only 18bp apart, hence their very tight linkage (r<sup>2</sup>=1).gs278 reflects a gene-gene interaction between this SNP and a NR3A SNP, rs10989591, in which older adults with a particular combination of genotypes at these two (independent) loci are reported to exhibit better episodic memory.

DRD3,Rs6280,"rs6280, also known as '''Ser9Gly''', is a SNP in the dopamine receptor D3 DRD3 gene.

Ser9Gly has been implicated in executive function in some studies, but the results are conflicting.  Gly/Gly carriers showed significantly (p = 0.002) poorer performance than Ser/Ser carriers on executive functioning tasks in a somewhat small Caucasian sample (84 patients with first-episode psychosis and 85 controls).  Gly/Ser heterozygotes had 23% more preservative errors on the WCST compared to Ser/Ser homozygotes in a small (216) healthy Han Chinese sample (p = 0.009). Differences between homozygotes were not statistically significant.  No association between WCST scores and Ser9Gly was found in 138 schizophrenic patients.

DSP,Rs2076295,"The SNP '''rs2076295''' on chromosome 6p24 is located within the intronic region of the DSP gene, which encodes the protein desmoplakin. Desmoplakin is a component of the desmosome, and is an adhesive intercellular molecule that tightly links adjacent cells for cell-cell adhesion. It is part of a dynamic structure that involves other proteins, such as plakoglobin and plakophilins, which tether the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane . The minor allele rs2076295(G) is reported by dbSNP to have an allele frequency (MAF) of 0.454.A recent case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 1,616 cases and 4,683 controls (and a replication study with 876 cases and 1,890 controls) was performed on non- Hispanic white individuals with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) ; note the correction posted online 1 Oct 2013. The most common and severe form of IIP is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IFP), and all forms of IIP (including IFP) were included in this study, in which a total of 439,828 SNPs were studied. Using an additive model for the minor allele at each SNP, a total of 19 SNPs, representing 7 chromosome locations, with genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) were identified in the GWAS discovery process.Apart from SNPs that have been previously associated with IIP in the MUC5B, TERT, and TERC genes , many of the other genome-wide significant SNPs reported in this study were newly discovered risk loci for IIP. Among them is '''rs2076295''' (minor allele = G; P<sub>meta</sub> = 1.1 x 10<sup>-19</sup>), which is in the intronic region of the DSP gene, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.43 for IIP (discovery GWAS). A related lung tissue gene expression study (100 IPF cases, 94 controls) showed that DSP expression was down-regulated in cases when compared to controls (P = 0.0002), and the expression level was genotype-dependent on the SNP (P = 0.002) &#8211; relative expression of DSP decreased with the number of copies of the putative risk allele, with GG alleles having the lowest level of expression, and TT the highest. This is consistent with the additive model used in the discovery GWAS.IIP represents a group of lung diseases that are often characterized by pulmonary fibrosis or progressive scarring of the alveolar interstitium, which can eventually lead to hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency and death . Some forms are known to be associated with environmental exposures (e.g. asbestos), drug toxicity, radiation exposure, or collagen vascular diseases (e.g. scleroderma). Previous studies have focused on the association between IIP and the MUC5B, TERT, and TERC genes. MUC5B encodes mucin 5B, expressed in mucus-producing cells in the distal airways of the lung. Lung tissue from individuals with IIP has higher concentrations of MUC5B than controls. TERT and TERC are involved in the maintenance of telomere lengths, and mutations in these genes are associated with shortened telomeres in the alveolar epithelia.The recently discovered association with the DSP locus suggests that changes in cell-cell adhesion may also play a role in IIP. Desmosomes (and desmoplakin) are important in maintaining the integrity of tissues that experience mechanical stress (such as the peripheral portions of the lung), and there is strong evidence that perturbation of the desmosome disrupts epithelial homeostasis . Mutations in DSP have also been associated with other diseases that involve loss of tissue integrity, such as in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia , keratodermas , and alopecia .",1704

EDN1,Rs5370,"rs5370, also known as Lys198Asn or K198N, is a SNP in the endothelin-1 EDN1 gene on chromosome 6. The generally more common rs5370(G) allele encodes the Lys (K), and the rarer rs5370(T) allele encodes the Asn (N). Among the French-Canadian founder population of the Saguenay Lac St-Jean region of Quebec, rs5370(T) was associated with lower HDL cholesterol values in women (p = 1.3 x 10e-5), but not in men. In a study of 1,000+ Western Australians, no association was seen between HDL levels and rs5370. A study of ~400 rheumatoid arthritis patients found a 3x increase in the adjusted odds of being hypertensive for rs5370(T;T) homozygotes compared to (G;G) homozygotes (odds ratio 2.89, CI: 1.02 - 8.19, p=0.011).

After adjusting for age, sex, race, etiology, and severity of cirrhosis the number of (G) copies led to an odds ratio for either (G;G) or (A;G) genotypes versus the (A;A) genotype of 3.49 (CI: 1.29-9.44, p=.01). In another study, analysis of 197 glioma patients showed that the rs4444903(G) allele conferred higher risks for gliomas (odds ratio 1.32, CI: 1.04-1.67), glioblastomas (OR, 1.47, CI: 1.02-2.10), and oligodendrogliomas (OR, 1.55, CI: 1.07-2.23). In general, the risk was about the same for a carrier or one or two (G) alleles, however, no significant association was observed with patients' overall survival.A study of 126 Indian gallbladder cancer patients concluded that the rs4444903(G;G) genotype was at increased risk, but only in females (odds ratio 3.45, CI: 1.52-7.82, p = 0.003).effects lots of no known riskpmids15373782 15729146 16214932 16214933 16214934 16214935 16217151 16217152 16217153 rs4444903, rs2298991, rs7692976 and rs4533485 significantly interacted with gender for acute respiratory distress syndrome  risk.popular in pubmed Epidermal growth factor gene polymorphism is different between schizophrenia and lung cancer patients in Korean population.

For a more complete discussion, see rs6025., In addition to the literature associating the G20210A variant with thromboembolism in general, several studies have found that this variant significantly (2 - 20 fold) increases the risk for ischemic stroke (aka cerebral ischemia) in individuals with patent foramen ovale (PFO), or hole in the heart. It is estimated that PFO is present in ~25% of the (normal/healthy) population. JAMA discusses the value of testing this snp for venous thromboembolism",1832
F5,Rs1800595,"This polymorphism is also known as Factor V HR2, H1299R, His1299Arg (due to the resulting change from Histidine to Arginine in the protein) and A4070G (due to the allele being G instead of A).Research shows that is related to the more commonly known ""Factor V Leiden"" mutation rs6025 .""Factor V Leiden is present in 5% to 7% of the general population and 20% to 40% of individuals with venous thrombosis.

F5,Rs6025,"rs6025 represents a SNP in the Factor V F5 gene, encoding a change in the protein from an arginine at position 506 to a glutamine. The resulting rs6025(A) allele encodes a mutation known as the Leiden mutation, R506Q. This mutation is often referred to as the G1691A or 1691G-A change.See the  OMIM entryIn a 2017 study using UK Biobank, based on 3290 VTE cases and 116 868 controls, the odds ratio for a polymorphism involving the minor risk allele was 3.5. They also found higher odds for venous thromboembolism in overweight individuals (+1.57 for every 1 SD higher BMI).  In a 2013 meta-analysis of 31 databases, the analysis of Factor V rs6025 variants was based on 9,081 cases and 17,513 controls. The polymorphic variant risk for Venous Thromboembolism was overall OR: 4.38. The risk was greater in younger subjects (<45 years old, OR: 5.43; ≥45 years old, OR: 3.71). Slightly higher risk appeared in men (OR: 5.06) and in women taking oral contraceptives (OR: 6.10). The AG polymorphic variant was associated with recurrent thrombosis (recurrent VTE event, OR: 5.81; no recurrence reported, OR: 3.95). The higher risks were for venous thrombosis without evidence of pulmonary embolism (OR: 4.49) or a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (OR: 4.14). The AA homozygous variant was rarer, and its risk was significantly higher at 11.45 but was based on fewer individuals (116 subjects among cases and 24 controls). Independent risk was seen in variants of the PT20210A or Factor 2 SNP at i3002432 (also known as rs1799963 ) Other studies have come to similar conclusions. In a 2004 study of over 9,000 Caucasian adults in the Danish population, rs6025(A;G) and rs6025(A;A) genotypes had 2.7x and 18x higher risk for venous thromboembolism, respectively, than rs6025(G;G) individuals. The lowest absolute 10-year risks for venous thromboembolism for (A;G) and (A;A) genotypes were 0.7% (CI: 0.5% to 1.0%) and 3% (CI: 1% to 8%) for nonsmokers younger than 40 years of age with a body mass index below 25 kg/m2, and the corresponding highest risks were 10% (CI: 7% to 14%) and 51% (CI: 13% to 100%) for overweight smokers over 60.In a study done in the year 2000 on 119 women, it was found that women who are pregnant and rs6025(A) carriers could be at risk for obstetric complications, including pre-eclampsia or venous thromboembolism, especially if they were also prothrombin rs1799963 heterozygotes and/or have a family history of thrombosis. They concluded that if you assume an overall risk rate of 1 in 1500 pregnancies, the risk of thrombosis among rs6025(A)  carriers by itself would be 0.2 percent (1 in 500); among carriers of the prothrombin rs1799963(A) by itself, would be 0.5 percent (1 in 200); and among carriers of both variant SNPs, 4.6 percent (about 1 in 20).A 2006 review article of 10 previous studies found that women who are rs6025(A) carriers also are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism and perhaps ischemic stroke when they take combined oral contraceptives (i.e. ""the pill""). A 2006 literature meta-analysis from a total of 10 studies concluded that ""good"" evidence existed for a greater risk of venous thromboembolism (risk ratios of 1.3-25.1) and cerebral vein or cerebral sinus thrombosis when comparing heterozygotes taking such contraceptives to heterozygotes who did not. Additionally, a 2004 meta-analysis involving 18,000 cases and 58,000 controls found an increased risk for ischemic stroke for rs6025(A) carriers. The odds ratio based on a study of ~4,500 patients was 1.33, CI: 1.12-1.58.Although preliminary, a 2010 study found that women taking tamoxifen as part of their treatment for early-stage breast cancer, those who had a thromboembolic event were nearly five times more likely to have a rs6025(A) allele compared to those who did not have a TE. The authors suggest that postmenopausal women should be evaluated for the rs6025(A) SNP before being given a prescription for tamoxifen if the result would affect the decision. A related editorial pointed out that tamoxifen on its own is known to increase the risk of thromboembolic events 2-4 fold.According to a 1999 Blood journal article, coexistence of the R2 polymorphism rs1800595 with factor V Leiden increased the risk for venous thrombosis approximately to a 16-fold increased risk.  The average age of the first thrombotic event is six years younger in individuals who are heterozygous for both factor V Leiden and the R2 polymorphism than in those with factor V Leiden alone.   1999 study concluded that heterozygotes for rs6025 and rs1799963 have an increased risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis after a first episode and are therefore candidates for lifelong anticoagulation treatment.

F5,Rs6427196,"rs6427196 is located in the F5/NME7 region on chromosome 1q24.2 at position 167747847.  This SNP is in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of F5.  F5, also known as coagulation factor V (proaccelerin, lavile factor), encodes an essential cofactor of the blood coagulation cascade and defects in this gene have been known to result in either an autosomal recessive hemorrhagic diathesis or an autosomal dominant form of thrombophilia.  Recently, this SNP has been found to be associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE).  VTE, which can manifest itself as either deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common cardiovascular condition with a high mortality rate .  Annually, ~2 million adults develop DVT and approximately 600,000 PE hospitalizations and 60,000 deaths occur .  In a study done by Tang et al., a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted by first analyzing the top SNP associations for total incident VTE in CHARGE (cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology) and then the second-stage studies were performed using data from three case-control studies: the Mayo Clinic VTE Study, the MARseille Thrombosis Association VTE Study, and a French case-control study on early-onset VT.  In the CHARGE GWAS, 1,618 VTE cases were included from 44,499 participants, all of which were of European origin.  From that, the top 1,047 SNPs identified as having the greatest association were analyzed in 3,231 VTE cases and 3,536 controls.The initial CHARGE GWAS revealed that the rs6427196 G minor allele had a risk ratio (RR) of 1.82 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.58 to 2.10.  The p-value of this association was 1.97 x 10-16.  The second-stage analysis gave a RR of 2.31 with a 95% CI of 2.04 to 2.62 and a p-value of 2.56 x 10-38.  At this point, all the studies were combined to give an overall RR and p-value which indicated rs6427196 as the highest associated SNP with VTE.  The overall RR was 2.07 (95% CI = 1.89 &#8211; 2.28) and a p-value of 4.47 x 10-51.",1839

FAAH,Rs324420,"rs324420, also known as c.385C>A or Pro129Thr, is a SNP in the fatty acid amide hydrolase FAAH gene, which has shown associations with some substance use disorders. rs324420(C) encodes the more common Pro, while the (A) allele encodes the Thr.Among 80 individuals with drug abuse or alcoholism and over 1,000 controls, the odds ratio for risk of problem drug or alcohol use among rs324420(A;A) individuals was 4.5 (CI: 2.2 - 8.4); the odds ratio for risk of street drug use was 2.2 (CI: 1.3&#8211;3.7); and the odds ratio for risk of combined street drug use and problem drug/alcohol use was 4.9 (CI: 2.5&#8211;9.7)When this study was pooled with the results of another study of 249 subjects with documented multiple different drug addictions compared to drug free individuals of the same ethnic backgrounds, the results were consistent and even more significant (p = 0.00003). Risk for drug dependence (and drug abuse was associated with rs324420(A;A) homozygotes. In a study of 40 daily marijuana users who abstained for 24 h and were then presented with a cue-elicited craving paradigm, followed by smoking a marijuana cigarette, rs324420(A) was significantly associated with changes in withdrawal after abstinence and with happiness after smoking marijuana, but was not associated with changes in heart rate after smoking or with changes in craving or other acute effects.This variant has also been associated with pain insensitivity. In a 2016 study, ~1000 women undergoing surgery for breast cancer were tested for cold and heat pain sensitivity; rs324420(A;A) individuals reported significantly lower cold pain sensitivity and less need for postoperative analgesia. The rs324420(A;C) genotype was also seen in a woman with unusually high pain tolerance, along with a ~8kb heterozygous microdeletion of the adjacent FAAH pseudogene.And from a different perspective, a 2016 study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies found ""a strong correlation between a nation's happiness and the presence of the (rs324420) A allele in the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) gene"".

FCGR2A,Rs1801274,"rs1801274 is a SNP in the Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIa, receptor (CD32) FCGR2A gene. rs1801274(C) encodes the arginine (R) allele, with the (T) allele encoding the variant histidine (H). The (H) isoform is considered high-binding to IgG2 and IgG3, while the (R) isoform is considered low-binding. This SNP is known in the literature by many names, including A519C and H131R. What's the importance of this? FcgR isoforms expressed on immune system cells have been linked to the pathogenic consequences triggered by autoantibodies or immune complexes in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as to the efficacy of some immunotherapeutic treatments such as rituximab.Many studies have been published about this FCGR2A SNP, roughly divided by either disorder or treatment as follows:  HIV to AIDS, including susceptibility and progression   In a study of HIV-infected men, those with a FCGR2a CC genotype progressed to a CD4+ cell count of <200/mm3 at a faster rate than individuals with either of the other genotypes (relative hazard = 1.6; p = 0.0001). However, the authors noted that the progression to AIDS was less impacted by this SNP, largely because TT homozygotes had an increased risk of pneumonia as an AIDS-defining illness.   Lymphoma   A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. The AG and AA genotypes of rs1801274 were associated with higher risk of follicular and small lymphocytic lymphomas: 1.26x (95% CI, 1.01-1.56) and 1.41x (95% CI, 1.10-1.81), respectively (P(trend) = 0.006). Hemophilia A  In a case-control study of 85 individuals a more than 3-fold increased risk of inhibitor development was found compared to patients with the RR genotype  Malaria   Based on a study of more than 1,800 individuals in India, rs1801274(T;T) homozgyotes were significantly associated with protection from disease manifestation, with stronger association observed in the malaria non-endemic region.   Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)   A study of 90 Japanese patients with SLE concluded that individuals with rs1801274(C) alleles were at higher risk for the disease. Classifying the reports by immunotherapeutic treatment studied yields the following:  Studies involving cetuximab:   In a study of 39 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab, the rs1801274(T) (ie H) allele was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.055), by perhaps 1-2 months.   Studies involving infliximab:   A study of 91 patients with rheumatoid arthritis found that at week 30 of treatment with infliximab, rs1801274(C;C) homozygotes had a better ACR20 response (RR: 60% and HH-RH: 33.3%; p= 0.035).   Studies involving rituximab:   In a study of 58 Croatian patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rs1801274 did not influence response, event-free or overall survival.   Studies involving 3F8, an anti-GD2 antibody:   In a study of 136 patients with high risk neuroblastoma treated with the anti-GD2 antibody 3F8 plus GM-CSF immunotherapy, the rs1801274(C;C)(ie R/R) genotype was correlated with progression-free survival for the entire cohort (p = .049) and for the subset of patients with no history of prior relapse (p = .023).

The (V) isoform is considered high-binding to IgG1 and IgG3, while the (F) isoform is considered low-binding. This SNP is known in the literature by many names, including A559C, T559G, 158F/V, and 176F/V.What's the importance of this? FcgRIIIa stimulatory receptors are expressed by most cells in the immune system, including monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, platelets and endothelial cells, as well as a subpopulation of T-cells. FcgR isoforms have been linked to the pathogenic consequences triggered by autoantibodies or immune complexes in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as to the efficacy of some immunotherapeutic treatments such as rituximab.Many studies have been published about this FCGR3A SNP, roughly divided by either disorder or treatment as follows:  HIV to AIDs, including susceptibility and progression:   In a study of 2 cohorts of men infected with HIV, the rs396991(T;T) (ie F/F) genotype was underrepresented in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, whereas the heterozygous genotype was associated with its development. A similar association was observed between rs396991 genotypes and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) seropositivity.  Crohn's disease   A study of 300+ patients with Crohn's disease determined that the rs396991(T) allele had an odds ratio of 1.58 (CI: 1.06-2.35) and the (G;T) genotype an odds ratio of 1.64 (CI: 1.08-2.5) for the disease.  Rheumatoid arthritis   Meta-analysis of 10 different studies concluded that amongst European subjects (and not Asians), the VV (rs396991(G;G)) genotype was associated with increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis, with an odds ratio of 1.374 (CI: 1.101-1.714, p = 0.005) as compared to the FF genotype.   Although rs396991 is unlikely to play a major role by itself in susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of the rs396991(G) high-binding allele may predispose shared epitope positive individuals to the disease.Classifying the reports by immunotherapeutic treatment studied yields the following:  Studies involving rituximab:   In a study of ~200 Korean patients, the FCGR3A valine (V) allele was significantly correlated with a higher complete response rate to rituximab plus cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy compared with the phenylalanine (F) allele (88% in V/V vs 79% in V/F vs 50% in F/F; p = .002), although it did not correlate with survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).   In a study of 58 Croatian patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rs396991 did not influence response, event-free or overall survival.   A study of 49 patients receiving rituximab for previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma concluded that rs396991(G;G) patients have a 75% to 90% chance of experiencing a clinical response to rituximab monotherapy, whereas patients with at least one rs396991(T) allele have a 25% to 51% chance of responding.   Another study of 89 patients with follicular lymphoma found that rs396991 genotype was associated with the response rate and freedom from progression after treatment with rituximab.   Studies involving cetuximab:   In a study of 39 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab, the rs396991(G) (ie F) allele was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.055), by perhaps 1-2 months.  Studies involving trastuzumab:   A retrospective analysis of 1,251 patients included in a phase III trial of women with ERBB2/HER2-positive breast cancer concluded that rs396991(G) carriers (i.e. FCGR3A-158 V carriers) benefit the most, as measured by disease-free survival, from trastuzumab use compared to rs396991(T:T) (i.e. FCGR3A-158 F/F) genotypes.",1891

It's role in cytokine production appears to be the key factor in this SNP's association with disease prognosis (but, interestingly, no role in disease susceptibility has been found to date).rs12212067(G), the minor allele, is connected to the downregulation of TNF and several other proinflammatory cytokines in response to various antigens, and, the upregulation of IL10, a cytokine associated with anti-inflammatory effects.

FTO,Rs9939609,"rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the ""Fat Gene"" . The original paper describing it is here .2015 research suggests rs1421085 may be the causal snp. The researchers identified 10 different FTO SNPs in the first intron of the gene that associated with both BMI and type-2 diabetes. Because they all correlated with each other, they chose to examine one of the SNPs (rs9939609) in detail.rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects. Furthermore, the minor allele frequency was much lower in Chinese populations compared to populations of European descent.  Note: The three FTO SNPs, rs1421085, rs17817449, and rs9939609, are in strong linkage disequilibrium (pairwise r<sup>2</sup>>0.97), and there are two primary haplotypes, C-G-A (42.0 %) and T-T-T (55.5 %). 1,638 type 2 diabetes patients and 1,858 controls rs9939609 in FTO (OR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.25, p = 0.006) A study of 3,000+ UK children indicated that (A;A) genotypes were less satieted (i.e. had greater appetite) than other genotypes, indicating this risk allele for obesity is likely to influence appetite. This SNP is also associated with (severe) obesity in a study of 927 Japanese patients. This SNP may contribute to variation in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels independently of obesity; average CRP levels may be 12-14% higher per rs9939609(A) allele. This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.  A longitudinal study of Finnish children concluded that the effect of rs9939609 on BMI only becomes evident after age 7, and that the FTO gene is not directly associated with energy intake or physical activity. Independent of fatness, the A-allele of the FTO SNP appears to increase mortality of a magnitude similar to smoking, but without a particular underlying disease pattern barring an increase in the risk of diseases of the nervous system. Each copy of the risk-allele A at rs9939609 was significantly associated with 0.45 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.74; P = 0.004) and 0.97 cm increase in waist circumference (95% CI: 0.21-0.65; P = 0.0002).

G6PD,Rs1050828,"rs1050828, also known as c.292G>A, p.Val98Met and V98M as well as the G6PD A- mutation, is a SNP residing in the G6PD gene and is located the X chromosome. G6PD codes for the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which helps protect the cell from oxidative damage. Depending on genotype, an individual may possess one or two primary versions of the G6PD gene; type A and type B. Type A is predominantly found in people who have African ancestry. Mutations of G6PD can cause varying degrees of G6PD deficiency, which is a disease affecting red blood cells. For example, an G to A substitution mutation at the rs1050828 (also referred to as G202A) is associated with a reduction of G6PD.  The G6PD deficient genotype A- (~8-20% reduction of G6PD) is typically defined by the possession of the rs1050828 A allele (rs1050828(A;A)).  In addition, individuals who are type A- almost always possess the rs1050829 G allele. G6PD deficiency frequency is highest in malarial regions where G6PD deficient individuals are typically less affected by malarial infection ().  Also, the literature suggests that there is association between the rs1050828 locus and various red blood cell traits in African Americans.A 2019 publication reports that this variant also has the effect of lowering HbA1c values by ~0.88%-units in hemizygous men and 0.34%-units in heterozygous women. The authors suggest that when using Hb1Ac values to diagnose type-2 diabetes, those units should be added to the measured Hb1Ac level, and a diagnosis should then be made if the sum is >6.5% (the standard diagnostic threshold).   A total of 72 SNPs were genotyped in two populations in eastern Sudan (Hausa and Massalit), as well as, a cohort of malaria hospital patients and a control sample set (n=449).  The study found that in comparison to controls (n=69), Massalit individuals (n=60) who possess the rs105828 A allele were less susceptible to malarial infection (P=0.04). Study surveyed 49,094 SNPs (covering ~2,100 candidate genes)in Caucasian (n=23,439) and African American (n=7,112) individuals from five different population cohorts.  Genome wide association results include that rs1050828 A allele found in African American individuals is strongly associated with certain erythrocyte phenotypes including; lower red blood cell, hemoglobin and hematocrit counts (all p values <2.0 x 10 <sup>-13</sup>). In order to identify SNPs associated with different red blood cell phenotypic traits a genome-wide association study was conducted on African Americans (n=16,500). The SNP rs1050828 was found to be associated with hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and RBC count. A cohort of African American medical patients (n=1904) was analyzed in a genome-wide association study where loci were correlated with certain red blood cell traits.  The rs1050828 locus is associated with RBC count (P=4x10<sup>-13</sup>), mean corpuscular volume (P=1x10<sup>-14</sup>), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (P=9x10<sup>-9</sup>).",2094

Mutations of G6PD can cause varying degrees of G6PD deficiency, which is a disease affecting red blood cells.  For example, an A to G substitution mutation at the rs1050829 locus (also known as A376G) is associated with reduced production of G6PD enzyme. Other mutations causing G6PD deficiency include; rs1050828. The G6PD deficient genotype A- (~8-20% reduction of G6PD) is typically defined by the possession of both the rs1050829 G allele and the rs1050828 A allele. G6PD deficiency frequency is highest in malarial regions where G6PD deficient individuals are typically less affected by malarial infection ().The minor allele of this SNP should be reclassified as benign according to  Study of malaria in Gambian children uses the rs1050829 allele to help detect G6PD deficient individuals.

The study found that in comparison to controls (n=69), Massalit individuals (n=60) who possess the rs105829 G allele were less susceptible to malarial infection (p=0.02). In a G6PD deficient Jordanian clinical population, the A376G allele was found to be at a frequency of 21% in males (n=47) and 9% in females (n=16).

GADL1,Rs17026688,"rs17026688 is a SNP located in an intron of the glutamate decarboxylase-like 1 GADL1 gene. It is linked to rs17026651, and both are 100% linked to a 1 base deletion known as 'GADL1 IVS8+48delG' (rs201973599).In a study of ~1,700 patients of Han Chinese descent with bipolar disorder, researchers discovered that almost all of the patients who responded well to lithium treatment had at least one IVS8+48delG GADL1 allele. Initially, the researchers were focused on two nearby SNPs, rs17026688 and rs17026651, that turned out to be proxies (due to being in high linkage disequilibrium) for the deletion variant. rs17026688(T) is the ""response allele"", meaning that at least in these Asian patients, bipolar patients who are carriers of at least one (T) allele are predicted to respond well to lithium treatment; rs17026688(C;C) patients are predicted to respond poorly.The odds ratios and probabilities for this study are so high that the authors are able to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV; NPV) for the connection between this DNA variant and being a bipolar patient who will respond well (or not) to lithium treatment. In a pooled cohort of ~400 patients, roughly divided equally between those responding well to lithium or not, the odds ratios, p values, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were around 80, 1 x 10e-50, 93%, 87%, 83% and 95%, respectively. To put it another way, while overall about half of all patients had a response allele and half didn't, only 1 in 14 patients who responded well to lithium lacked a response allele, and only 1 in 8 of those who did not respond well had a response allele. The authors naturally suggest the use of these SNPs as useful biomarkers for which patients with bipolar disorder will respond well to lithium treatment, and they also intend to (1) look for additional GADL1 gene variants acting similarly, especially in non-Asian populations given the rarity of this particular deletion variant outside of Asian population, and (2) see if these variants influence lithium treatment outcomes in other affective disorders such as major depressive disorder.",2172

GATA3,Rs4143094,"'''rs4143094''' is a SNP identified by a genome-wide diet-gene interaction analysis (GxE), and was found to be associated with increased risk of colon cancer correlated to the dietary variable of processed meat consumption. It is located on chromosome 10p14, 7.2kb upstream of GATA binding protein 3 (''GATA3''), in the promoter region of the gene  rs4143094 was identified in a screen of 2.7 million SNPs for the risk of colorectal cancer, by combining 10 studies comparing 9287 cases and 9117 controls. Data was obtained from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and analyzed by conventional case-control logistic regression for multiplicative interactions between SNPs and dietary factors. rs4143094 was the most significantly implicated SNP in 10p14 for processed meat consumption linked with occurrence of colorectal cancer. The risk allele (T) has an ORinteraction=1.17, p=8.73E-09 with evidenced heterogenetity by p=0.78. When stratifying by genotype, rs4143094-TG has OR=1.2, 95% CI=1.13-1.26; rs4143094-TT has an OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.22-1.59; and the minor/null genotype rs4143094-GG has an OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.98-1.07.  Several other SNPs in the 10p14 region were correlated to the same phenotype, (rs485411, risk allele C, ORinteraction=1.18; Pinteraction=1.72E-08; rs1269486, risk allele A, ORinteraction=1.18, Pinteraction=7.53E-08) though rs4143094 was highlighted due to having the most significant P-value.Colorectal cancer is the third most leading cause of cancer death in men and women , and consumption of processed meat has been linked to increased risk of its development , . rs4143094 is upstream of ''GATA3'', a gene associated with Th2 cell differentiation , which is upregulated in ulcerative colitis , a risk factor for colorectal cancer . Though the mechanism by which ''GATA3'' suppression may lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer is unknown, its suppression has been previously linked to breast, colorectal, and lung cancers . DOJ  Association between risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat.rs4143094 on chromosome 10p14 is about 7.2kb upstream of GATA3 gene. GATA3 belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors. Its functional role includes regulation of luminal epithelial cell differentiation, development of T cell, and differentiation of T helper (Th) cell. Genes in the GATA family are involved in several types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and of particular interest to this entry, colorectal cancer    . According to dbSNP, rs4143094 has two alleles, G (major allele) and T (minor allele). The minor allele has a frequency of 0.2337 across all populations. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), using data from Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), discovered a strong correlation between rs4143094 and risk of colorectal cancer when ingesting red and processed meat . In the study, approximately 2.7M SNPs were tested across 9,287 case and 9,117 control subjects, all with European ancestry. The result shows that rs4143094 is associated with risk of colorectal cancer (P = 8.73e-9), with T being the risk allele. Specifically, individuals with TG and TT genotypes are increased for occurrence of colorectal cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 and 1.39, respectively. rs4143094 resides in a 9.5 kb linkage-disequilibrium (LD) block (r2 > 0.8) containing 19 highly correlated SNPs. The third most significant among these SNPs, rs1269486, is located 1420 bases upstream of GATA3 and is in a region of open chromatin (DNA hypersensitivity). Experimental evidence suggests binding activity of Pol2 and transcription factors c-Fos, JunD, and c-Jun in this region . Many other SNPs in the LD block reside in GATA3-antisense RNA1 (GATA3-AS1).  GATA3-AS1 may regulate GATA3 transcript activity, although further experimental evidence is required. Apart from the SNP, this study also observed that red and processed meat consumption increases risk for colorectal cancer with OR of 1.15 and 1.11, respectively. For this secondary result, the author proposed the following pathway: processed meat triggers pro-tumorigenic inflammatory or immunological response, whose recovery depends upon the expression of GATA3 gene. Further experimental evidence is required to confirm this hypothesis.",2212

GBA,Rs104886460,"rs104886460 represents a rare variation in the acid beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. Gaucher's disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to deficient activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase, and over 200 mutations have been described in the GBA gene, many of which lead to Gaucher Type I or Type II disease.The mutation encoded by rs104886460 is one of the top 5 or so Gaucher-related variations found in Ashkenazi Jews, and is known as ""IVS2+1G-A"". It is most commonly associated with Gaucher Type I disease but has also been seen associated with Type II disease, apparently depending on the nature of the ""other"" GBA mutation found in an individual (since it's a recessive condition requiring both alleles to be affected).See also: OMIM  606463.0015",2219
GBA,Rs1064651,"rs1064651, also known as Asp448His or D448H, is a SNP in exon 9 of the GBA gene on chromosome 1. As the protein was originally numbered, though, this variation occurred at amino acid 409 (rather than 448), so the scientific literature still often refers to this mutation as Asp409His or D409H.Mutations in both copies of a person's GBA gene may lead to Gaucher's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. When one of the mutations is the D409H mutation, the clinical description may be Gaucher disease type 3C, involving valvular heart disease. However, the clinical presentation appears to be highly variable as well as dependent on which two mutations are present. For more information, see OMIM  606463.0006.Be aware that since this mutation is due to a G>C (tranversion) when oriented in the direction the gene is transcribed, interpretation can be problematic due to  orientation issues involving  ambiguous flips.",2220

GBA,Rs421016,"rs421016, also known as L444P or Leu444Pro, is a SNP causing an amino acid change in the GBA gene; it is among the most common mutations associated with Gaucher disease of any type.  Amino acid predictions from genome sequence may predict this as L483P or Leu483Pro; this disparity in position calling may be due to a 39 peptide signal sequence. Polyphen 2 predicts  P04062 L483P to be ""possibly damaging"" with a score of 0.857 (sensitivity: 0.83; specificity: 0.93). ( P04062 is the uniprot ID for GBA.)The risk allele (in current dbSNP orientation) is (G), and as the inheritance is autosomal recessive, individuals must either be compound heterozygotes (for two different GBA mutations) or rs421016(G;G) homozygotes to develop Gaucher disease. There are over 300 mutations now known to occur in the GBA gene, with many associated with increasing risk for either type I, II, or III Gaucher disease.This SNP (along with others associated with Gaucher disease) is studied extensively in Ashkenazi Jewish populations where it is found in relatively high frequency.Note: this SNP used to have a ""mirror"" SNP, rs35095275, representing the opposite strand yet the same exact nucleotide position; it has now been merged into this SNP.One copy of rs421016(G) has also been shown to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease ~5 fold across multiple ethnicities, and to lower a bit the age of onset of Parkinson's. In one study, the estimated age-specific risk for Parkinson's disease at 60 and 80 years of age was 4.7% and 9.1% among Gaucher disease patients, i.e. those carrying two Gaucher GBA mutations, compared with 1.5% and 7.7% among GBA mutation heterozygotes, and 0.7% and 2.1% for carriers of zero Gaucher GBA mutations, respectively.

GDF5,Rs143383,"This SNP is associated with osteoarthritis (OA). It is located in the ''five prime untranslated region'' (| '''5&#8242;UTR''') of the gene encoding ''growth differentiation factor 5'' (| '''GDF5'''), a chondrogenic protein active from the embryonic stage onwards. GDF5 is also known as ''cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein 1'' or ''BMP14''. The '''risk allele T''' (+ 104T/C;rs143383) causes reduction of the GDF5 promoter sequence activity. Reduction of GDF5 in human cartilage of patients with OA by up to 27% has been observed . This effect is '''influenced by a second SNP ( rs143384 , C/T )''' in the same area. The C alleles of both SNPs form CpG dinucleotides. Demethylation of both SNP's increases GDF5 expression.  Thus the authors conclude that epigenetic manipulation offers options in developing therapies for OA. rs143383 showed significant association with hip osteoarthritis in two independent Japanese populations. It also showed association with knee osteoarthritis in Japanese and Chinese populations. is  not  a risk factor for osteoarthritis in Greek CaucasiansA subsequent study showed that the same risk allele, rs143383(T), was (somewhat) associated with osteoarthritis in European populations. The odds ratio was 1.10 for the allele, 1.28 for carrier status (p=0.03, p=0.004, respectively). The (T) allele appears to make less GDF5 protein, which eventually renders an individual somewhat more susceptible to osteoarthritis.A meta-analysis combining data from 11,000+ individuals as well as both European and Asian populations found strong evidence (p < 0.0004) confirming increased risk for osteoarthritis from the rs143383(T) allele. The best model is a dominant one, and the odds ratio reported is 1.21 in general and 1.48 for the dominant model.Another meta-analysis of 14 studies concluded that rs143383 did indeed show significant association with osteoarthritis, at least for knee osteoarthritis, and probably for hand and hip (but to a lesser degree). The effect size wasn't large, though (odds ratio 1.15, CI: 1.09-1.22, p = 9.4 x 10e-7).A haplotype of rs143383 and rs6060369 can be defined, which also links osteoarthritis to height since rs6060369 was linked to height in a study ultimately involving over 28,000 individuals.The  Medpage article on this finding notes that rs143383 was previously shown to be associated with increased risk for osteoarthritis and in this recent study  it was significantly associated with shorter height in the initial scans, at p=2.70x10e-5.Note that the authors of  refer to rs143383 in the opposite orientation compared to it's entry in dbSNP.

GLCCI1,Rs37973,"rs37973 is a SNP in the promoter region of the glucocorticoid induced transcript 1 GLCCI1 gene on chromosome 7. In asthmatics corticosteroid treatment increases GLCCI1 protein in lung white blood cells. This increase is suggested to be followed by the inflammatory cells apoptosis and resolution of the inflammation.  The amount of GLCCI1 protein induced by glucocorticoids was significantly lower in the bronchial epithelial cells of rs37973(G;G) patients as compared to wild type homozygotes possibly resulting in inferior response..Based on 4 populations totaling 900+ asthma patients, the rs37973(G) allele was associated (p = 0.0007, pooled data) with less improvement of lung function in response to inhaled glucocorticoids such as budesonide. The mean (&#177;SE) increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in treated rs37973(G;G) patients was about one third of that seen in rs37973(A;A) patients (3.2&#177;1.6% vs. 9.4&#177;1.1%). Based on dividing the response into highest vs lowest quartiles of response, the allelic odds ratio of falling into the lowest responding quartile based on an additive genetic model was calculated to be 1.52 (CI: 1.13 - 2.03). Genotype accounted for about 7% of overall inhaled glucocorticoid response variability.This result failed to replicate in an analysis of corticosteroid clinical trials in a population of 1,900 non-Hispanic white patients with asthma. rs37973 did not influence change from baseline in forced expiratory volume. There was only a non-significant trend toward less response in rs37973(G;G) patients.In a study of 400 Japanese patients with bronchial asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroids, the pulmonary function was not significantly different in rs37973(G;G) compared with rs37973(A;A) genotypes.

GNB3,Rs5443,"rs5443, a SNP in the G-protein beta3 subunit (GNB3) gene that is more commonly known as the C825T variant, has been linked to a number of metabolic conditions including obesity, coronary artery disease, insulin resistance and therefore diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertension. It has also been linked to how well a patient responds to Viagra (sildenafil). Several studies have been unable to replicate one or more of the associations in at least some populations between this SNP and these conditions. The more notable studies include: rs5443(T) allele carriers are 2-3 fold more likely to be obese in Caucasian, Chinese, and African American populations.  rs5443(T) carriers are clearly at higher risk for hypertension, but this review indicates that whether they are also at increased risk for stroke and left ventricular hypertrophy remains controversial.  rs5443(T;T) women gain significantly more weight during pregnancy than rs5443(C;T) or rs5443(C;C) women, and had a significantly higher pre-pregnancy body mass index.   rs5443(T;T) genotypes respond to Viagra better. 91% of them have a ""positive erectile response"" upon taking Viagra, whereas only around 50% of rs5443(C;T) and rs5443(C;C) individuals respond equivalently to the drug. The odds ratio for the positive response was 10.0 (CI: 1.2 - 81.1, p = 0.01).   rs5443(T;T) patients receiving clozapine over a long term for the treatment of schizophrenia gain significantly more weight (16%) compared to patients carrying at least one rs5443(C) allele in a study of Chinese patients.  rs5443(T) carriers taking triptans for the treatment of migraines or cluster headaches were ~3 fold more likely to respond positively compared with rs5443(C;C) homozygotes (OR 2.96, CI:1.34 - 6.56, p=0.0074) in a study of ~200 Caucasian patients.  rs5443(C;T) genotypes are more prevalent in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients relative to healthy controls (odds ratio 1.43, CI: 1.04&#8211;1.98). rs5443(C;C) individuals do not lose weight under sibutramine therapy whereas (C;T) and (T;T) individuals do, based on a study of 131 obese Taiwanese patients. / 23andMe blog",2371

Detailed haplotype analysis was conducted, indicating rs5848 as most likely causal variant. FTLD-TDP43 is divided into four subtypes, some sources suggest association with type 3 only . Association between rs5848(T;T) and frontotemporal dementia is now generally assumed in literature, despite some studies failing to reproduce it.First meta-analysis of rs5848 association with Alzheimer's disease combining previous five studies for a total of 2502 Alzheimer's disease cases and 2162 controls found association in homozygous model (TT vs. CC: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11-1.66; P=0.003) as well as recessive model. This association existed also in the Caucasian-only subset of 2227 cases and 1902 controls. Although the ''p''-value is above usually applied guidelines, the researchers concluded the data indicates association exists .  According to ""First symptoms--frontotemporal dementia versus Alzheimer's disease""  as well as other sources frontotemporal dementia is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease so it is possible some studies have misdiagnosed cases. FTLD is characterized by behavioral and/or language dysfunction, but usually without the amnesic syndrome involved in Alzheimer's disease at early stage.In contrast ""Reduced serum progranulin level might be associated with Parkinson's disease risk""  found that only Parkinson's disease was associated with reduces progranulin levels, but found no association between progranulin levels, rs5848 or Alzheimer's disease. ""Association between GRN rs5848 polymorphism and Parkinson's disease in Taiwanese population"" found association between rs5848 and Parkinson's disease, but only for female Taiwanese (OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.43, 95% CI: 1.11-1.87, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.007 for single T allele among females). Most studies have found association with neurodegenerative disorders only for recessive or homozygous model, but this is one study where odds ratio follows number of alleles (OR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.24-3.78, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.006 for two alleles among females).A functional effect is suggested in many studies such as ""GRN variant rs5848 reduces plasma and brain levels of granulin in Alzheimer's disease patients""  and ""Rs5848 variant influences GRN mRNA levels in brain and peripheral mononuclear cells in patients with Alzheimer's disease"" . In addition ""rs5848 polymorphism and serum progranulin level""  showed that progranulin level is affected by number of (T) alleles equally both in 100 patients with different forms of dementia and 36 controls: TT (164 ng/mL, 95% C.I. 138-189), CT (191 ng/mL, 95% C.I. 177-206) and CC (222 ng/mL, 95% C.I. 205-238) serum progranulin with p < 0.005.

This SNP is also known as GSTP1Val105, or GSTP1 Ile105Val.Despite evidence of antioxidant effects of vitamin E in vitro and in animal studies, large, randomized clinical trials have not substantiated a benefit of vitamin E in reducing inflammation in humans. In healthy control subjects, the effect of &#945;-tocopherol supplementation on the production of inflammatory cytokines appears to be dependent on an individual's genotype. These genotype-specific differences may help explain some of the discordant results in studies that used vitamin E. Persons having the alleles AA or AG had an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon supplementing alpha-tocopherol (the most common form of Vitamin E in a North American diet) while those with GG saw a decrease. This  research paper shows that 13- to 21-year-olds exposed to tobacco smoke at home, with this mutation had more severe asthma than those without the mutation. rs1695 is also mentioned in this  bbc articleSeveral papers published findings associating GSTP1 Ile105Val genotypes with bronchial, childhood, or atopic asthma. Note that some studies, however, have not observed any association between this SNP and asthma in certain populations , or even more paradoxically, have observed that rs1695(G;G) homozygotes appear to be somewhat protected (OR 0.29) from developing asthma compared to individuals with rs1695(A;G) or (A;A) genotypes. A cohort of 1,610 children in the US were studied to determine that the risk for new-onset asthma was highest in rs1695(A;A) homozygotes who participated in 3 or more sports in high-ozone communities.

HABP2,Rs7080536,"rs7080536, also known as c.1601G>A, p.Gly534Glu and G534E, is a variant in the HABP2 gene on chromosome 10. Originally noticed in a group of individuals from Marburg, Germany, the rs7080536(A) allele and corresponding variant protein is also known as the Marburg I (MI) variant. The HBAP2 gene may also be referred to as FSAP (Factor VII Activating Protein or Protease) in some texts.The rs7080536(A) allele is associated as a risk factor for several conditions, including:  Carotid stenosis    A study of 800+ individuals found odds ratio of 6.6 CI:1.6 - 27.7.  Clinical stroke   A study of 8,000 individuals concluded that the Marburg I polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of clinical stroke (HR 1.60, CI: 1.13-2.28) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.33, CI: 1.04-1.71).  Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)   In a relatively small study (300 patients, 200 controls), the Marburg I variant was seen as an independent risk factor for VTE (OR 3.5, CI: 1.2-10.0) and  also idiopathic VTE (OR 6.2, CI: 2.0-18.9).   A larger study of ~900 patients determined that the Marburg I variant was associated with the development of deep venous thrombosis (OR 1.65, CI:1.16-2.34) and recurrent thromboembolic events (OR 2.13, CI; 1.35-3.36) OR (95% CI).   Familial Nonmedullary Thyroid cancer   Carriers of a Marburg I variant have about a 2x higher risk for thyroid cancer based on a study of 400+ patients. Functional studies indicated that the HABP2 protein may normally have a tumor-suppressive effect, but the G534E variant results in a loss of that function.",2445

This HLA allele, in turn, has been associated with several conditions.A study of 51 cases of flucloxacillin drug-induced liver injury (DILI), an important cause of serious liver disease, along with a replication study of another 23 cases, found that the rs2395029(G) carriers were at highly increased risk (odds ratio 80, p=8.7x10(-33)).  see also: / 23andMe blog rs2395029(G;G) increases the odds of drug-induced liver injury in response to flucloxacillin by 45x This SNP is thought to be involved in determining the HIV viral load set point during the asymptomatic period of infection. This SNP is estimated to explain 9.6% of the total variation in the viral set point.Humans show remarkable variation in vulnerability to infection by HIV-1 and especially in the clinical outcome following infection. One striking and largely unexplained difference is the level of circulating virus in the plasma during the non-symptomatic phase preceding progression to AIDS. This is known as the ''viral set point'' and can vary among individuals by as much as 4 to 5 logs. The HCP5 (HLA complex P5) gene is located 100 kb centromeric from HLAB on chromosome 6.  HCP5 is a good candidate to interact with HIV-1, possibly through an antisense mechanism. Moreover, HCP5 is predicted to encode two proteins, and the associated polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution in one of these.rs9264942 is also reported to be associated with reduced HIV viral load set point.In most European populations, the rs2395029(G) allele is in tight linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 1) with the HLA-B 5701 allele, and therefore is predictive of hypersensitivity to the drug abacavir, an antiviral used to treat HIV+ individuals. However, the linkage between rs2395029 and HLA-B 57:01 is not well studied in African and Asian populations, and in one Italian population, the linkage is questionable.. nature Abacavir hypersensitivity rs2395029 rs2395029 reported to be associated with psoriasis in a large US/UK study rs2395029 was found to be associated with psoriasis based on a study by the eMERGE network in which electronic medical records were searched to find clinical associations associated with selected SNPs.

A study of 200+ German patients indicated that (G;G) homozygotes were at 2x increased risk (CI: 1.32-2.92, p = 0.0007) for cluster headaches.A meta-analysis of 3 pooled studies concluded that the rs2653349(G;G) genotype showed a higher disease risk compared to the remaining genotypes (odds ratio 1.69, CI:1.11-2.58).Not all studies have found this association; a study of Northern Europeans did not find an association.Also, a study has been performed to find out if treatment success for cluster headaches is correlated with rs2653349 genotype. Among 184 Caucasian patients, while the rs2653349(G) allele was significantly associated with cluster headaches, treatment outcomes with triptans, oxygen, verapamil and corticosteroids were not.Independently, a study has been performed to see if rs2653349 might be associated with migraine; in this study at least, the answer was no.

HFE,I3002468,hemochromatosis related; better known in dbSNP nomenclature as rs1800730/ discussion at 23andMe,2515
HFE,Rs1799945,"rs1799945, also known as H63D or His63Asp, represents a SNP that accounts for a mild form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload condition in which mutations of certain genes involved in iron metabolism disrupt the body&#8217;s ability to regulate uptake of iron, causing increased intestinal iron absorption. The most common form is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which are inherited recessively. The gene for HH is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 . In 1996, HFE, a gene for HH, was found to have two missense mutations . A mutation at amino acid 282 (C282Y) was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH. This is a point mutation from guanine to adenine, resulting in a missense mutation from cysteine to tyrosine. Such mutations are commonly found in people with European ancestry, and is more rare in Asian and African populations. Among individuals of northern European descent, hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited identified genetic disorder. However, penetrance differs between different populations.==HFE Gene==The HFE gene encodes the human hemochromatosis protein, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 at 6p21.3. The protein regulates iron absorption by regulating the interaction of the transferrin receptor with transferrin. The HFE protein interacts with TFRC, the transferrin receptor protein 1, so its primary mode of action is through regulation of the iron storage hormone hepcidin.====Mutations in the HFE Gene====The three most common HH-causing mutations in the HFE gene (chromosome 6p21.3) are C282Y (A at rs1800562 instead of G), H63D (G at rs1799945 instead of C), and S65C (T at i3002468 instead of A). At least 17 other mutations in the HFE gene have been linked to HH. 60-90% of people with HH have two copies of the C282Y mutation. The H63D mutation is also quite common&#8212;about 20% of people carry a copy of the mutation, and about 3% have two copies. This mutation is not as severe as the C282Y mutation, and only causes symptoms when someone has both the H63D and the C282Y mutations. Even then, only a small fraction of people with one copy of each mutation actually exhibit evidence of iron overload. Additionally, those who have two copies of H63D do not exhibit any symptoms and are not at risk for iron overload. The S65C mutation is less common, and will also only cause symptoms if in combination with C282Y. For both H63D/C282Y and S65C/C282Y single mutation individuals, symptoms are usually mild if they develop at all.==Influence on Iron Levels==HH has four main pathophysiological mechanisms : the increased absorption of dietary iron in the upper intestine, 2) decreased expression of hepcidin, 3) altered function of the HFE protein, and 4) tissue injury and fibrogenesis induced by iron. Since the HFE gene encodes for proteins that affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis, this mechanism will be further explained in more detail. The HFE gene regulates the liver protein hepcidin, which is considered to be the principal iron-regulatory hormone. Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.==Symptoms of Hereditary Hemochromatosis==The symptoms of HH depend on the person&#8217;s mutation as well as their sex and diet. The older a person, the more likely iron has accumulated in the body over time. Typically, complications may develop later in life between the ages of 40 and 60 in men and in post-menopausal women. If symptoms do develop, these are typically seen in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and testes. At first, one may feel symptoms such as joint pain and stiffness, fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Later symptoms may lead to more serious conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, liver failure, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and arthritis.====Symptomatic Findings in Patients with HH==== Liver- hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver failure Joints- arthritis, swelling, chondrocalcinosis Heart- dilated cardiomyopathy, CHF Skin- increased pigmentation Endocrine- testicular atrophy, hypogonadism Hypothyroidism",2516
HFE,Rs1800562,"rs1800562 represents a SNP that accounts for ~85% of all cases of hemochromatosis, a disorder whose symptoms include cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, hypermelanotic pigmentation of the skin, and heart failure.  OMIM indicates that liver cancer is responsible for about one-third of deaths of rs1800562(A;A) homozygotes, and since hemochromatosis is a relatively easily treated disorder if diagnosed, this is a form of preventable cancer.The rs1800562(A) allele is known as the C282Y or Cys282Tyr mutation, and it is found at a frequency of around 5-10% in many Caucasian populations, leading to an incidence of (A;A) homozygotes around 1 in 200. Early identification of rs1800562(A;A) homozygotes can prevent complications of hemochromatosis; however, the percentage of all (A;A) homozygotes who actually develop clinical signs of hemochromatosis may be relatively low, may depend on sex (see below), and appears to be influenced by other SNPs yet to all be discovered as well as (unidentified) environmental factors, possibly including the amount of iron in the diet.In rs1800562(A;A) patients who do develop hemochromatosis, a SNP has been identified which increases the risk of cardiomyopathy (a form of heart disease). rs4880(T;T) homozygotes are at ~10 fold increased risk for dilated- or non-dilated cardiopathy based on a study of 217 patients.rs235756, a SNP in the BMP2 gene, is another SNP that may influence the development of hemochromatosis in rs1800562(A;A) individuals, at least if serum transferrin levels are a good indication. Transferrin levels increased with increasing copies of the rs235756(T) allele.  So what percent of rs1800562(A;A) individuals actually develop clinical signs of hemochromatosis? At least in the UK (Caucasian) population, a 2019 survey reported that of 2890 participants homozygous for p.C282Y (0.6%, or 1 in 156), hemochromatosis was diagnosed in 21.7% of men and 9.8% of women over an average follow up (~7 years). p.C282Y homozygous men aged 40 to 70 had a higher prevalence of diagnosed hemochromatosis (OR 411.1, CI: 299-565, p<0.001), liver disease (4.30, 2.97-6.18, p<0.001), rheumatoid arthritis (2.23, 1.51-3.31, p<0.001), osteoarthritis (2.01, 1.71-2.36, p<0.001), and diabetes mellitus (1.53, 1.16-1.98, p=0.002), versus 175,000+ controls (people with no p.C282Y mutations). During the seven year follow-up, 15.7% of homozygous men developed at least one incident associated condition versus 5.0% (p<0.001) with no p.C282Y mutations; for women, it was 10.1% vs 3.4%, p<0.001).Women who are rs1800562(A) homozygotes are less affected by hemochromatosis due to elimination of excess iron during menstruation, but may become affected after menopause.Carriers of one rs1800562(A) may be affected by a mild form of hemochromatosis if also a carrier of rs1799945(G) H63D.According to  Coriell, in Caucasian populations: (A;A) - 0.4% of individuals, carrying 2 copies of the risk variant (33-57% of such males will have quite elevated iron levels; 3-16% if female) (G;A) - 12% carry 1 copy of the risk variant and 1 copy of the non-risk variant (G;G) - 87.6% carry (only) the non-risk variant Was the C282Y mutation an Irish Gaelic mutation that the Vikings helped disseminate? Conclusion: The C282Y frequency shows a west to east decline from Ireland through the north of Europe. Vikings may have been involved in the spread of C282Y, but the mutation is probably older and may have been spread in Europe by earlier seafarers.",2517

This SNP is estimated to explain 9.6% of the total variation in the viral set point.Humans show remarkable variation in vulnerability to infection by HIV-1 and especially in the clinical outcome following infection. One striking and largely unexplained difference is the level of circulating virus in the plasma during the non-symptomatic phase preceding progression to AIDS. This is known as the ''viral set point'' and can vary among individuals by as much as 4 to 5 logs. The HCP5 (HLA complex P5) gene is located 100 kb centromeric from HLAB on chromosome 6.  HCP5 is a good candidate to interact with HIV-1, possibly through an antisense mechanism. Moreover, HCP5 is predicted to encode two proteins, and the associated polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution in one of these.rs9264942 is also reported to be associated with reduced HIV viral load set point.In most European populations, the rs2395029(G) allele is in tight linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 1) with the HLA-B 5701 allele, and therefore is predictive of hypersensitivity to the drug abacavir, an antiviral used to treat HIV+ individuals.

However, the authors of  seem to disagree. (Of course, other significant genetic and/or environmental factors could be protecting the multitude of individuals with AG). In several other lines of their table, the allele identified as the risk allele is _not_ the minor allele. The authors are aware of the conventions for ODs for risk vs. protection, stating that risk allele ODs will be normally 1-2 and protective ODS are between 0.5-1 (Supplement 1, page 3). In light of this, if they wished to signify the G allele was protective, they would have given a protective allele odds-ratio in the range 0.5-1 to AG. Of course, any OD as large as 5.49 (for AG), much less 18.25 (for AA) is quite a significant risk factor compared to all other ODs on its table. Yet it cannot be a typographical error, since the rs9272346 OD of 5.49 and P values were replicated in their Supplement 1 page 43.  Their significant P values were confirmed to some degree in a 2015 study listed on this page.

This gene is a member of the abdominal B subfamily, which have posterior domains of expression, including in the vertebrate urogenital system. HOXB13 maintains a relatively high level of expression in the adult prostate. G84E consists of the non-conservative replacement of a glutamic acid for a glycine at this position in the HOXB13 protein.In early 2012, findings were published based on exome sequencing of 200 genes spanning the ch17q21-22 region of primarily Caucasian prostate cancer patients (and matched controls). Deemed a ""rare but recurring mutation"", rs138213197(T) was discovered and then validated in a larger case-case study. Overall, rs138213197(T) was reported to lead to a 20-fold higher risk for prostate cancer, based on having been observed in 72 of ~5,000 patients but in only 1 person out of 1400 controls (so overall odds ratio 20.1, CI: 3.5 - 803.3, p=8.5&#215;10&#8722;7).Subsequent studies convincingly replicate this result:    Confirmed with odds ratio of 7.1 (CI: 4.62&#8211;10.78, p = 10e-19) based on 10,000 patients of various ethnicities (and ~60,000 controls).    Confirmed with odds ratio of 3.4 (CI: 2.2&#8211;5.4, p = 10e-6 or less) based on 5,000 Swedish patients. For this population, male G84E carriers have an estimated 33% cumulative risk to age 80 yr of prostate cancer, compared to 12% (CI: 11&#8211;13) among noncarriers.     Confirmed with odds ratio of 5.8 (CI: 1.3 - 26.5, p = .01) based on 1,800 Canadian patients.    Confirmed with odds ratio of 3.3 (CI: 1.21 &#8211; 8.96) in 1,300 Caucasian men.    Confirmed with odds ratio of 7.9 (CI: 1.8 - 34.5, p = .0062) based on 928 Caucasian patients.    G84E not present in 671 Chinese patients or 1,536 controls, but a novel HOXB13 SNP, G135E found by sequencing in 3 of the cases (and no controls).Is rs138213197 also associated with breast cancer risk? Maybe, maybe not - it's too early to tell:    This study of 4,000+ Canadian and Polish patients indicates not; frequency of allele was 0.16%.    Of 877 patients, 6 women with BRCA1/2 wild-type, familial breast cancer (none Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry had the variant, hence an odds ratio 5.7 (CI: 1-40, p=0.02).Additional studies examining the origin of the G84E variant have determined that the haplotype background it is seen within is observed most frequently in Nordic countries, most strikingly within the Finnish population, suggesting that rs138213197 is a founder mutation that arose around the year 1800 in Northern Europe.",2593

HTR2C,Rs6318,"rs6318 (Cys23Ser / C23S or 68G>C / G68C) is a SNP within the serotonin 2C receptor HTR2C gene located on the X chromosome. Since it is located on the X chromosome, males will be hemizygous and either (C;-) or (G;-), whereas females will either homozygous (C;C) or (G;G) or heterozygous (C;G). In most of the studies cited below, heterozyous (C;G) females were roughly statistically equivalent to females carrying the common non-risk (G;G) genotype.One relatively large (4,000 men and 2,000 women) study published in late 2013 of Caucasian catheterization patients has studied the association between rs6318 genotype and risk of having an ""end"" cardiac event, defined as either death or a heart attack, in the years following entry into the study (i.e. presumably following their catheterization). Patients were followed for up to 11 years, with a median follow-up time of 5.3 years. Different rs6318 genotypes had statistically significant differences in their odds of having end cardiac events as follows: 29% of (G;-) men; 35% of (C;-) men; ~26% of (G;G) or (C;G) women; and 36% of (C;C) women. This works out to hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model for male rs6318(C;-) compared to the more common (G;-) males of 1.23 (CI: 1.02-1.36, p=0.02), and 1.62 (CI:1.07-2.47, p=0.02) for female (C;C) genotypes compared to the more common (G;G) females. The authors postulate that rs6318 is associated with higher stress-related cortisol levels, and suggest (without any evidence so far) that rs6318(C;C) women and (C;-) men may benefit from either behavioural therapy or the use of a serotonin receptor antagonist such as agomelatine.

The aim of the study was to map SNP/gene associations with environmental pathogen-richness in relation to genomic variations across geographic human populations. This 2009 article found that ""six risk alleles for inflammatory bowel (IBD) or celiac disease are significantly correlated with micropathogen richness. These data support the hygiene hypothesis for IBD and provide a large set of putative targets for susceptibility to helminth infections."" (Abstract) Table I. identified rs3024490 among a list of 44 SNPs analyzed in relation to micro- and macro-pathogens. This SNP was not previously associated with IBD and celiac disease and was negatively associated with pathogen richness.  This 2009 study identified a haplotype among Ghanaians consisting of minor alleles at four SNPs in the IL-10 gene: rs1800871, rs1800872, rs3024490 and rs1554286. This combination of risk alleles led to lower IL-10 expression and higher TNF gene expression, resulting in a pro-inflammatory response. The authors explain that in Ghana, ""pro-inflammatory alleles rescue their carriers of excess mortality in adverse environmental conditions"" such as drinking from boreholes, and thus minor alleles occur more frequently in African populations, but ""in an affluent environment, the same pro-inflammatory response leads to increased mortality,"" and minor alleles occur much less frequently (i.e. in Caucasian populations).",2702

IL6,Rs1800795,"rs1800795 is a SNP in the promoter of the interleukin-6 IL6 gene, affecting the levels made of this important cytokine. In the literature, it is almost universally referred to as the IL6 ""-174"" polymorphism. It tends to be quite polymorphic in Caucasians, but Asian and African populations are almost monomorphic (for the (G) allele).It was first described in 1998, when it was shown that the rs1800795(C) allele produces less IL6 than the (G) allele, which supported the hypothesis that a protective genotype against systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis would be rs1800795(C;C), and indeed, few juvenile RA patients had that genotype.Studies on rs1800795 now include potential associations with heart disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, type-2 diabetes, stroke, obesity, Hodgkin's lymphoma, sudden infant death syndrome, cancer (including breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer), hypertension, periodontitis, and complications arising after organ transplantations or grafts. It is worth noting that some of the associations seen for rs1800795 alleles are not for the risk of developing a given disorder; instead, they relate to how a disorder might progress or respond to various treatments. Summaries of several major associations are available at  OMIM.The rs1800795(G) allele, generally associated with higher levels of IL6, has been associated with increased risk in the following studies:  The rs1800795(G) allele was significantly associated with type-2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.51, CI: 1.11-2.07, p=0.0096) in a study of 700 elderly Caucasians.  Following a kidney transplant, patients with rs1800795(G;G) genotypes have a higher risk of new-onset diabetes and higher C-reactive protein levels) compared to the (C;C) genotype. Since this was more pronounced in overweight patients, the authors suggest that diabetes-inducing drug administration should be limited in overweight patients who are rs1800795(G;G) following renal transplantation.  The development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after lung transplantation is more likely and happens earlier for rs1800795(G) carriers.  Among HIV+ men, the lifetime risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma is higher for rs1800795(G;G) homozygotes compared to (C;C) homozygotes.  Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma who are rs1800795(G;G) were less likely to be successfully treated, with odds ratios for failure of 1.75 (CI: 1.04-2.92, p=0.03).  A study of 139 elderly males with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) indicated that rs1800795(G;G) genotypes were at 3.89 fold (CI: 1.71-8.86, p=0.001) higher risk of dying within one year of their ACS event than (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes.  Although the odds of having a stroke weren't different, among patients (in this case, under 60 years of age) who did have a stroke those with a rs1800795(G;G) genotype had more severe disability after 1 week (odds ratio 3.2, CI: 1.5-6.6, p=0.002).  Among Chinese patients with hypertension, the rs1800795(G) allele is more common, and (G;G) genotypes had significantly higher plasma PAI-1 activity than (C;C) genotypes.  In 168 Brazilian patients, rs1800795(G) allele frequency was higher in gastric cancer than in patients with chronic gastritis.   Although the odds of having Crohn's disease aren't affected, among 153 children with it, those with the rs1800795(G;G) genotype were more growth-retarded at diagnosis than (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes. (G;G) patients also had higher circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP).   rs1800795(G) carriers don't increase their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels after 24 weeks of aerobic exercise as much as rs1800795(C) carriers.  The rs1800795(G;G) genotype was more frequent in Australian infants with sudden infant death syndrome (58%) than in control subjects (38%, p=0.02). This was not seen in a Norwegian population.  Women with endometriosis who are rs1800795(G) carriers appear to be more likely to develop chocolate cysts, and (G) allele carriers may be at slightly higher risk of developing endometriosis.  The rs1800795(G) allele is more frequent in women with hyperandrogenism than in controls.  Children with the rs1800795(G;G) genotype are more likely to have recurrent acute otitis, based on a study of 348 patients, with an odds ratio of 1.64 (p=0.02).   (G) allele is increased risk ((C) allele is decreased risk) for type-2 diabetes; this SNP is one of 4 relatively common SNPs reported to represent risk for type-2 diabetes in the DESIR prospective study of 3,877 Caucasian participants. Under an additive model, the odds ratio for rs1800795(C) carriers is 0.79 (CI: 0.65-0.96, p=0.01). For the 4 SNPs, each risk allele increased type-2 diabetes risk by 1.34x (p=2x10e-6), with an odds ratio of 2.48 (CI: 1.59-3.86) for carriers of 4 or more compared to those with one or none (risk alleles).The rs1800795(C) allele, generally associated with lower levels of IL6, has been associated with increased risk in these studies:  rs1800795 (C;C) and (C;G) Caucasians who are excessively heavy (body mass index ~33 +/- 5kg/m2) are at increased risk (odds ratio 5.2, p=0.003) for developing obesity-related metabolic disorders such as hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.  Among 571 patients with type-2 diabetes, the rs1800795(C) allele is correlated with higher body mass index, but it showed no correlation among non-diabetics.  A study of 238 Caucasians with type-2 diabetes concluded that rs1800795(C) carriers have an insulin resistance ""IL-6-sensitive"" phenotype and perhaps strategies to manage insulin resistance should be different between (C) carriers vs. (G;G) patients.  In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) being treated by hemodialysis, rs1800795(C) allele carriers had higher diastolic blood pressure (p=0.008) and a higher left ventricular mass index (p=0.026) than (G;G) homozygotes. Among diabetic patients in dialysis, the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in (C) allele carriers was 87.5% vs. 36.3% among (G;G) genotypes (p= 0.02).  Among recipient of a kidney transplant, rs1800795(C) allele carriers had worse three-year graft survival (71/104 = 68.3%; p=0.0059) with a 3.7-fold increased relative risk of graft loss compared to rs1800795(G;G) genotypes (48/54 = 88.9%). The authors suggest that determining the rs1800795 genotype may offer a new method for identifying patients at increased risk of allograft loss.  Among prostate cancer patients, the rs1800795(C) allele is associated with more aggressive cancer and higher prostate-specific antigen levels compared to rs1800795(G;G) homozygotes.  Although the rs1800795(C) allele was not associated with a higher frequency of heart attacks, it did have an association with inflammation and infarcts detectable only by MRI, suggesting that rs1800795(C) may chronically predispose an individual to develop atherosclerosis.  The combination of carrying at least one rs1800795(C) and one rs1205(T), a SNP in the C-reactive protein gene, led to higher risk of a stroke after cardiac surgery (odds ratio 3.3, CI: 1.4-8.1, p=0.0023) compared to individuals who were rs1800795(G;G) and rs1205(C;C).  The rs1800795(C) allele was associated with higher postoperative IL6 levels and a less favorable clinical outcome following coronary revascularization surgery.  The rs1800795(C;C) genotype was significantly higher in the group of 122 adult periodontitis patients than in controls (odds ratio 1.896, CI: 1.1-3.2, p=0.0283).  The degree of periodontitis was more severe in rs1800795(C) carriers than (G) carriers.  The rs1800795(C) allele was over-represented in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls and the (C;C) genotype was associated with higher risk in women.  The rs1800795(C) allele was higher in non-survivors compared to (nonagenarian) survivors in a case/control study of ~100 pairs of matched Finnish individuals; to put it another way, the rs1800795(G) allele may be associated with increased longevity. rs1800797, rs1800796 and rs1800795 have been shown to affect both the transcription and secretion of IL-6, to symptomatic distal interphalangeal osteoarthritis based on 535 women. the G alleles of two promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) G-597A and G-174C were more common among the subjects with symptomatic DIP OA than among those with no disease (p-values corrected for multiple testing 0.020 and 0.024). Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001). Carriage of the G-G diplotype indicated an increased risk of both symmetrical DIP OA (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28) and symptomatic DIP OA (OR 3.67 95% CI 1.50 to 9.00) Suggests that ""healthy elderly individuals may have a proinflammatory profile playing as a downregulating factor for inducible Hsp70, particularly if -174 G/C-negative"" and that therefore, a nutraceutical intervention (fermented papaya preparation 9 g/day) might be of benefit. rs1800795 coronary artery disease 190 affected Asian Indian sibling pairs",2782

JAK1,Rs11208534,"rs11208534 is a polymorphism within intron 3 of the Janus-activated kinase (JAK1) gene on human chromosome 1.  This SNP is reported by dbSNP as having A (ancestral) and G alleles, with a minor allele frequency of 19.2% (dbSNP). JAK1 is a membrane-associated protein-tyrosine kinase involved in the interferon-alpha/beta and &#8211;gamma pathways, which are important for immune responses to pathogens. Activation of JAK-family proteins occurs after binding of interferons to cell-surface receptors, and results in tyrosine phosphorylation of members of the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) protein family, inducing the expression of many other genes involved in diverse biological processes including various antiviral responses .This SNP has been associated with increased risk of developing severe symptoms upon infection with dengue virus. Symptoms of dengue infection vary widely in severity, and are classified by the WHO (listed in order of increasing severity) as undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and severe hypovolemic shock, or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DF commonly includes high fever, general flu-like symptoms, and sometimes severe bleeding. DHF is characterized by high fever, major hemorrhaging, circulatory failure, and extremely low blood platelet counts and if untreated can progress to DSS ( correlation was found between rs11208534 and the development of symptoms consistent with DHF in a 2010 study in Brazil of individuals seropositive for dengue virus . The top hit out of 728 SNPs in 56 genes predicted to be involved in a cellular response to viral infection was rs11208534, for which the authors report T (major) and C (minor) alleles of rs11208534, not A and G as on dbSNP. Cases (n = 50) were recruited from patients with DHF-like symptoms by active hospital surveillance in the city of Salvador, Brazil. Controls (n = 236) who had experienced symptoms of DF, but not DHF, were recruited from families living within 1 kilometer of index cases, and were matched in age categories under and over 15 years. The association between rs11208534 and DHF (P-value 2.9x10-4; OR 5.2 (95% CI 2.1-12.7) just failed to reach the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 2.6x10-4 by itself, but when combined with two other highly linked SNPs in the JAK1 gene region, rs310196 and rs2780831 (D&#8217; 0.856 and 1.0 to rs11208534 respectively), the association reached significance with a P-value of 2.1x10-4. This study provides evidence that polymorphisms in the JAK1 gene, including this one, may provide differential susceptibility to dengue virus infection, and likely other viruses as well.

KIF6,Rs20455,"rs20455, often called Arg719 or 719Arg, is a reasonably well studied SNP in the KIF6 gene. The risk allele (encoding the arginine at position 719) is rs20455(C).An extensive 2010 meta-analysis, including over 17,000 patients, suggests this variant does not significantly influence coronary artery disease risk.This SNP is one of the 5 used by Celera's genetic risk score (GRS) for coronary heart disease (CHD).  rs20455, in the KIF6 gene rs3900940, in the MYH15 gene rs7439293, in the PALLD gene rs2298566, in the SNX19 gene rs1010, in the VAMP8 geneFor each of the five variants, the GRS was increased by 1 if the subject was homozygous for the risk variant, unchanged if heterozygous, and decreased by 1 if the individual did not carry the variant. Therefore, individuals carrying all 10 possible risk variants (two copies of each of the five SNPs) were assigned a GRS of 5 and those carrying no risk variants a GRS of -5. A high GRS was defined as 3 or higher. Approximately 4% of the white cohort in ARIC was classified as high risk, and the hazard ratio for CHD after adjustment for traditional risk factors was a significant 1.57 (CI: 1.21-2.04; p<0.001). The results did not reproduce for African American participants. Carriers of the 719Arg allele of KIF6 have 34% higher risk of myocardial infarction and 24% higher risk of coronary heart disease compared with noncarriers among 25,283 women. Carriers of 719Arg receive significantly greater benefit from intensive statin therapy than do noncarriers. The benefit from intensive (compared with moderate) statin therapy was significantly greater in the 59% of the 1,778 patients who were carriers (hazard ratio 0.59, CI: 0.45 -0.77) than in those who were noncarriers (HR 0.94, CI: 0.70-1.27; p=0.018 for interaction between 719Arg carrier status and treatment). The absolute risk reduction was 10.0% in carriers versus 0.8% in noncarriers. Untreated carriers of the rs20455 risk allele had odds ratios for MI or stroke of 1.50 and 1.55 (CI: 1.05-2.15 or 1.14-2.09) in two large clinical trials. Among treated carriers, the absolute risk reduction by pravastatin therapy was 4.9% and 5.5% (CI: 1.81-7.9% or 3.5-7.5%). Therefore, in both trials carriers of a rs20455(C) SNP had an increased risk of coronary events, and statin treatment (in this case, pravastatin) reduced that risk more for such carriers than for noncarriers. Elderly carriers of a rs20455(C) (719Arg) allele with prior vascular disease received significant benefit from pravastatin; however, no benefit was observed in noncarriers with prior disease or in those without prior disease (carriers or noncarriers). Across all ethnic groups studied, pravastatin therapy significantly and substantially reduced both fatal coronary events and nonfatal myocardial infarctions only for carriers of the 719Arg allele (and not for noncarriers).",2910

Together with rs9527025 (C370S), which it co-segregates with, a haplotype (""KL-VS"") has been described that is reported to increase klotho secretion and may alter its functions; the alternative haplotype is named KL-FC (due to the F from F352V and C from C370S). The klotho protein is a hormone found primarily in the kidney and choroid plexus of the brain. At the genetic level, the Klotho gene is reported to affect longevity in mice  and perhaps humans , and KL-VS heterozygosity (but not homozygosity) has been associated with greater brain cortical volume . At the protein level, older adults with higher plasma klotho concentrations tend to show lower less decline with age on standardized cognitive tests , adults with higher stress tend to have lower plasma klotho levels , and transgenic mice bred to have excess human amyloid precursor protein (to simulate Alzheimer's disease) score better on some tests when their klotho levels are increased .Most of the studies cited above for studies of klotho in humans should be considered preliminary for at least two reasons: they are not based on large sample sizes, and, they haven't been replicated by independent investigators. In addition, there is a report showing no difference in the klotho plasma levels between FC/FC and FC/VS individuals , as well as a report showing KL-VS heterozygotes had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers , in contrast to the studies cited above.

LOXL1,Rs1048661,"rs1048661, also known as R141L, a SNP causing an amino acid change in the lysyl oxidase 1 LOXL1 gene, has been linked to exfoliation glaucoma. This form of glaucoma causes up to 10% of the cases of blindness in many countries, including the US. Science DOI: 10.1126/science.1146554 From the abstract of this study: ""Approximately 25% of the general population is homozygous for the highest risk haplotype and their risk of suffering XFG (exfoliation glaucoma) is over 100 times that of those only carrying low-risk haplotypes.""The risk allele for this SNP is rs1048661(G), and it confers a estimated relative risk (by itself) of 3.04. The odds ratio is 2.46 (CI 1.91-3.16). Note that the (G) allele is actually quite common in most European populations.However, a meta-analysis published in 2010 concluded that it's likely that SNPs rs1048661 and rs2165241 are not directly implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma; only the nearby rs3825942 seemed to be the disease-associated SNP.In the original publications, the haplotypes identified as being of highest risk consisted of the combination of two SNPs together, rs1048661(G) and rs3825942(C), oriented with respect to the dbSNP entry. In the two populations studied combined (from Iceland and Sweden), the (G;C) haplotype has an odds ratio of 27.05, and the (T;C) haplotype has an OR of 8.90, relative to the (G;T) haplotype. The (T;T) haplotype is presumed to be at even lower risk than the (G;T) haplotype, but due at least in part to the high frequency of the rs1048661(G) allele, no individuals in this study carried it. In the populations studied, ~25% of all individuals in the population carry two copies of the (G;C), highest risk haplotype.If the risk of carrying two such haplotypes is multiplicative (which isn't known actually), the authors estimate that individuals carrying two copies of the (G;C) high risk haplotype would have 700 times the risk of developing this type of glaucoma compared to individuals carrying two copies of the (G;T) haplotype. Overall, (G;C) individuals are at ~2.5 fold higher risk than the average person in the populations studied.With so many people at high risk, shouldn't the number of cases be much higher? Not necessarily, since glaucoma risk only becomes high in older individuals. To put it another way: plenty of folks don't live long enough to find out if they would have gotten glaucoma. The estimate for glaucoma incidence worldwide is 10-20% only for individuals over 60 years of age; in Iceland, where glaucoma incidence is high, 40% of individuals 80 or older show signs of exfoliation ''syndrome'', which has been seen to convert to exfolation ''glaucoma'' at a rate of 60% - over a 15 year period.

LOXL1,Rs2165241,"This SNP, located in an intron of the LOXL1 gene, was initially reported to be associated with exfoliation glaucoma. However, it was shown in the same study to no longer be significant once two other SNPs, which cause actual changes in the LOXL1 protein, were identified. More specifically, the risk allele rs2165241(T) was found to be associated with glaucoma only because it effectively predicted (with 90% probability) the actual high-risk haplotype consisting of rs1048661(G) and rs3825942(C), as oriented with respect to their entries in dbSNP. However, a meta-analysis published in 2010 concluded that it's likely that SNPs rs1048661 and rs2165241 are not directly implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma; only the nearby rs3825942 seemed to be the disease-associated SNP.  rs2165241 was significantly associated with XFG and XFS (p=4.13x10e-9 for an additive model, heterozygote odds ratio = 4.42 (CI: 2.3-8.5), homozygote odds ratio = 34.19 (CI: 4.48-261), with the rs2165241 (T) allele being the risk allele, found in 83.1% of cases versus 52.4% in controls, based on a study of 62 Caucasian patients.

From the abstract of this study: ""Approximately 25% of the general population is homozygous for the highest risk haplotype C;C here combined with other risk SNPs and their risk of suffering XFG (exfoliation glaucoma) is over 100 times that of those only carrying low-risk haplotypes.""The risk allele for this SNP is rs3825942(C), as oriented with respect to the dbSNP entry, and it confers a estimated relative risk (by itself) of 27 compared to the (T) allele. The odds ratio is 20.10 (CI 10.80-37.41). Note that the (C) allele is actually quite common in most European populations.A meta-analysis including 24 articles across 5 ethnicities (Caucasian, African, Japanese, Indian, and Chinese) concluded that rs3825942 is the common disease-associated SNP in all populations, whereas rs1048661 and rs2165241 were inconsistent. The odds ratio is approximately 10 for rs3825942(C;C), while the heterozygote rs3825942(C;T) was not statistically significant. rs3825942 was not associated with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).With so many people at high risk, shouldn't the number of cases be much higher? Not necessarily, since glaucoma risk only becomes high in ageing|older individuals. To put it another way: plenty of folks don't live long enough to find out if they would have gotten glaucoma. The estimate for glaucoma incidence worldwide is 10-20% only for individuals over 60 years of age; in Iceland, where glaucoma incidence is high, 40% of individuals 80 or older show signs of exfoliation ''syndrome'', which has been seen to convert to exfolation ''glaucoma'' at a rate of 60% - over a 15 year period.

Among rs3798220(C) carriers, the risk was reduced more than twofold by aspirin: for aspirin compared with placebo the age-adjusted HR was 0.44 (CI: 0.20-0.94). The risk was not significantly reduced among non-carriers (age-adjusted HR=0.91, CI: 0.77-1.08). This interaction between carrier status and aspirin allocation was significant (P=0.048). In summary, rs3798220(C) carriers had higher plasma lipoprotein(a) and had double the risk of cardiovascular events, but also benefited more from taking aspirin. In another study, compared with noncarriers, carriers of the 4399M risk allele (2.7% of controls) had an adjusted odds ratio for severe CAD of 3.14 (CI: 1.51 to 6.56), and had 5-fold higher median plasma lipoprotein(a) levels (P=0.003), leading to the conclusion that the LPA I4399M SNP is associated with severe CAD and plasma lipoprotein(a) levels. celera says rs3798220 is an independent predictor of risk for  Coronary Heart Disease in men and women event reduction from low dose aspirin therapy in womenCarriers of the rs3798220(C) have higher levels of plasma Lp(a).",3033

LRRK2,Rs34637584,"First discovered in 2004, rs34637584 is a SNP indicating a position within the LRRK2 that encodes a variant protein. This SNP is commonly referred to as the G2019S variant (or, mutation) based on the potential change from glycine (encoded by rs34637584(G) allele) to serine (encoded by the rs34637584(A) allele) at position 2019 of the LRRK2 protein.Note: as of June 2016, we have noticed that this SNP is prone to being miscalled in AncestryDNA V2.0 datasets.One copy of a rs34637584(A) allele is sufficient to greatly increase one's risk for Parkinson's disease. It is considered a disease causing mutation because it is rarely found in healthy, elderly people without Parkinson's disease, and it has been found in both familial and sporadic types of the disease. While there are many different SNPs that can influence one's risk for Parkinson's disease, rs34637584 is an especially common cause of the disease in Berber Arabs and Ashkenazi Jews. Overall, the risk of Parkinson's disease for a person who inherits a rs34637584(A) allele is 28% at age 59, 51% at 69, and 74% at 79, according to the International LRRK2 Consortium.This SNP  has been associated with disease at varying frequencies in Asian (<1%), European (1%&#8211;7%), North American (1%&#8211;3%), North African (34-41%), and Ashkenazi (10&#8211;25%) sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease patient populations .The G2019S mutation is also common not only in Parkinson's disease patients but also in controls at a frequency of 2.2% in North African Berber-Arabs (13/597, ), 1.4% in Sephardic Jews (5/361, ) and 1.3% in Ashkenazic Jews (4/317, ) while it is found at a very low frequency of 0.06% in Europeans (1/1550, ) and not found in sub-Saharan Africans.Individuals with G2019S who share the most common haplotype (mainly Europeans, Jews and North-Africans) very likely share a common ancestor estimated to have lived 1,525&#8211;1,830 years ago between the second and fifth centuries A.D. either in the Middle East  or in  North Africa . In contrast, other authors hypothesized that LRRK2 G2019S might be of Phoenician origin, rather than Arabic-Berber or Jewish, dating from the founding of ancient Carthage in 814 B.C. . G2019S has been observed on two additional background haplotypes (one in European&#8211;Americans and one in Japanese) distinct from the main one observed in Europeans, North-Africans and Jews. This suggests that G2019S has arisen independently on at least three separate occasions. According to the most extensive and thorough study by Lesage et al. in 2010, estimations indicated that the LRRK2 mutation on the main haplotype initially arose among Near-Easterners at least 4,000 years ago, much earlier than in previous estimations. Because of a founder effect, the ancestors of present-day Ashkenazi Jews may have kept the low-frequency G2019S mutation through the different diasporas, whereas Near Eastern daughter populations lost the mutation. ""The mutation might then have been reintroduced by recurrent gene flow from Ashkenazi populations to other Jewish, European and North-African populations. The present-day frequency of the mutation in control populations (0.05% in Europeans, 0.5% in North-African Arabs and 1% in Ashkenazi Jews) may support this scenario""Is a carrier of at least one rs34637584(A) allele definitely going to develop Parkinson's disease if they live long enough? No. Several studies have found that overall the odds of developing the disease for G2019S carriers depends on age, family history, and ethnicity. The odds for G2019S carriers were calculated to be 15% at 60 years, 21% at 70 years, and 32% at 80 years in a study of Italian patients , whereas in a Jewish population the age-specific odds were 24% at age 80.Having a family history of Parkinson's disease in addition to carrying a rs34637584(A) allele is also associated with increased risk for the disease.Do the odds differ between carriers of one and two rs34637584(A) alleles? Apparently not; a study of North Africans - one of the few populations likely to have sufficient numbers of homozygote rs34637584(A;A) individuals to study due to the rarity of the mutation - there was no clinical difference between Parkinson's disease patients carrying one or two copies, and, 3 individuals (ranging from 42-70 years old) who were rs34637584(A;A) and yet did not have the disease were also observed.In 2019, a study concluded that compared to Parkinson patients due to other causes, G2019S-associated Parkinson patients had a ~10-fold higher chance of developing leukemia and a 2-fold higher chance of developing colon cancer, perhaps thereby meriting additional screening for those conditions. However, it was not clear if higher odds would have been seen in G2019S-carriers compared to healthy individuals not carrying the G2019S mutation.This SNP was in the news  in 2008 as one of Google's founders, Sergey Brin, announced that he and his mother (who has Parkinson's disease) both carry the G2019S SNP. Mr. Brin was 35 years old at the time of the announcement, and in his / blog, he comments that ""I now have the opportunity to adjust my life to reduce those odds"", which he states are ""somewhere between 20% to 80% depending on the study and how you measure"". Helixgene discusses this  extensively and concludes that people with G2019S have about a 25% chance of Parkinson's disease in their lifetime. This chance is greatly influenced by other factors including ethnicity and family history. BMC in LRRK2 is not fully penetrant in familial Parkinson's Disease and  commentarygs248 is relevant",3065

A 2011 study comparing MDM2 promoter status among different cohorts of ovarian cancer (n = 1993) and breast cancer (n = 1973) patients concluded that rs117039649(C) carriers were at reduced risk for both ovarian (odds ratio 0.74, CI: 0.58-0.94) and breast (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.62-1.00) cancer compared to SNP309G carriers (lacking SNP285).",3164
MDM2,Rs2279744,"rs2279744, a variant in the promoter of the MDM2 gene and also known as ""-410T-G"", ""SNP309"", and ""SNP309T>G"", has been studied for several years to determine it's role in cancer origin and treatment. The interest primarily stems from the ability of the MDM2 protein to bind to and thereby enhance the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein known as p53. Studies on rs2279744 include:  rs2279744(G) carriers in individuals with cancer tend to develop such cancers on average 12 years earlier than those lacking this allele, and the frequency of rs2279744(G) was greatly increased in those who developed soft tissue sarcomas at a young age.   Individuals with one or more rs2279744(G) alleles who are also carriers of the TP53 rs1042522(C) (arg at aa72) SNP tend to develop cancers earlier than rs2279744(T;T) homozygotes who carry the same p53 SNP.   rs2279744(T;T) individuals who have a mutant p53 (in their tumors) are at an increased risk of death (risk ratio RR of death = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.08 to 5.03). Tumor p53 status was not associated with breast cancer survival among rs2279744(G;T) or rs2279744(G;G) genotypes.   rs2279744 showed no association with nonsmall cell lung cancer risk in a study of 1,787 Caucasian patients. However, a possible association between nonsmoking (G;G) homozygotes and a higher risk of nonsmall cell lung cancer was reported.  A study in Chinese leukemia patients found that the rs2279744(G) allele was unexpectedly associated with reduced risk.  Another study concludes that this SNP on its own has little or no effect on the risk of common cancers, but it might modify the time of tumor onset and prognosis.   rs2279744(G;G) females are at a 2.76x increased risk (CI: 1.06-7.20, p=0.03) for endometrial cancer compared to (G;T) or (T;T) genotypes based on a study of 73 patients and matched controls.  A study of 148 individuals with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing first-line chemotherapy, such as the irinotecan plus cisplatin regimen, concluded after multivariate analysis that the rs2279744(T;T) genotype was independently predictive for longer survival (HR = 1.742, p = .032).   The rs2279744(G;G) genotype was associated with high grade breast cancer tumors (with an odds ratio of 1.64, CI:1.06-2.53, p=0.025) and greater nodal involvement (OR=2.51, CI:1.26-4.98, p=0.009), but was not associated with an earlier age of cancer diagnosis or even risk of breast cancer, in a study of ~300 Scottish Caucasian patients.  Around 300 cases each of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma were studied relative to this SNP. No significant associations were found between rs2279744 and any of these three types of skin cancer. However, compared with the (T;T) genotype, the adjusted odds ratios of having moles on the arms for (G;T) and (G;G) genotypes was 0.92 (CI: 0.78-1.08) and 0.68 (CI: 0.53-0.87), respectively (p, trend, 0.005).  rs2279744(G;G) women are diagnosed with melanoma 13 years earlier than women who carry one or no G alleles. Note that this SNP does not cause higher risk of melanoma; it affects only the age at diagnosis of melanoma in women and has no effect in men, as reported in the 23andMe blog / 23andMe blog.

But there is evidence for improved survival in women with ovarian cancer who have the G version of this SNP.  Paradoxically, higher levels of the MDM2 protein (as would be expected with the G version of SNP rs2279744 shown to lead to earlier melanoma onset in the current study) have been associated with improved survival for melanoma.  rs2279744 is not associated with SLE in a study of Caucasians, African-Americans, and Asian children and adults.  rs2279744, rs1042522, rs17878362 and rs1625895 associated with high grade endometrial cancer",3165

MDM4,Rs4245739,"Rs4245739 at 1q32 is located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region (UTR) of MDM4, positioned 32 bp downstream from the gene.  The MDM4 oncoprotein negatively regulates the tumor suppressor protein P53, effectively inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell growth.  Amplification of MDM4 is observed in multiple tumor types, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated SNP rs4245739 with several forms of cancer.SNPs that are situated in 3&#8217;-UTRs can potentially affect translation efficiency by altering miRNA-mediated gene regulation.  The '''rs4245739''' A > C polymorphism creates a novel binding site for miR-191 , thereby inhibiting expression of the ''MDM4'' oncogene.  Consequently, the major allele A acts as the risk allele, while the minor allele C is protective.===Prostate Cancer===A GWAS by Eeles et al.  linked rs4245739 to prostate cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related death for men in the developed world &#8211; especially in Europe and the United States.  Eeles et al. used the iCOGS chip to genotype 19,662 prostate cancer cases and 19,715 controls, all of European ancestry.  The results were subsequently pooled with data from a meta-analysis of 4 previous GWAS covering 11,085 cases and 11,463 controls in populations with European ancestry.  The combined results identified 77 loci associated with prostate cancer, which together explain ~30% of the disease&#8217;s familial risk.  One of the new SNPs identified was '''rs4245739''', which presented genome-wide significance (p = 2.1e-11).  The major allele A is the risk allele, with a per-allele odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05 &#8211; 1.14).  '''Rs4245739''' is correlated with rs1380576 (''r''<sup>2</sup> = 0.89), which has been linked to prostate cancer aggressiveness , as well as rs7556371 (''r''<sup>2</sup> = 0.89), which was associated with prostate cancer susceptibility in a candidate gene study .===Breast Cancer===Rs4245739 has also been linked to susceptibility for breast cancer, which ranks as the fifth-most common cause of cancer death worldwide.  In another GWAS utilizing the iCOGS array, Garcia-Glosas et al.  investigated loci associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, which account for ~25% of all breast cancer cases.  They genotyped 6,514 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 41,455 controls of European ancestry, the results of which were combined with a meta-analysis of 3 previous GWAS totaling 4,193 ER-negative cases and 35,194 controls, also of European ancestry.  SNP '''rs4245739''' was identified as one of four loci associated with ER-negative but not ER-positive breast cancer.  Based on the pooled results, the association with ER-negative breast cancer showed genome-wide significance (p = 2.1e-12).  The A risk allele presented an odds ratio of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.10&#8211;1.18).A candidate gene study  genotyped a total of 1,100 breast cancer cases and 1,400 controls from two regions of China.  This work focused specifically on breast cancer in relation to SNP '''rs4245739''' and its potential interplay with the P53 Arg72Pro genetic variant.  When compared to CA and CC, the AA genotype was found to be associated with breast cancer (p =  4.6e-6), with an odds ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.36&#8211;0.61) for the C protective allele.  For individuals with the P53 Arg/Arg genotype, the association was even stronger (p = 5.3e-12) with an odds ratio of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.08&#8211;0.27), suggesting a possible additive effect of ''MDM4'' and ''P53'' on breast cancer susceptibility.Additionally, smaller scale studies have reported association of rs4245739 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  and ovarian cancer severity and progression .",3168

MET,Rs2237717,"Rs2237717 (major: C, minor: T) is located in intron 11 within the MET proto-oncogene. The MET gene is primarily known to be involved in tumor metastasis . However, MET has also been shown to have roles in general neurodevelopment  and in the development of autism .  Rs2237717 has been linked to schizophrenia, ability to recognize facial emotion, and chronic rhinosinusitis. ==Association with schizophrenia and cognitive ability== Given that schizophrenic patients have a lower incidence of cancer despite more exposure to risk factors and relatives without schizophrenia appear to also have a protective effect on cancer incidence, it has been hypothesized that alterations in cancer genes (like MET, containing rs2237717) may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia . ===Schizophrenia===In a study by Burdick et al  which investigated the relation between SNPs in MET gene and schizophrenia, it was found that rs2237717 resided in an enriched haplotype of one of the four haplotype blocks. The &#8216;Block 3&#8217; haplotype was the most commonly underrepresented in the schizophrenia case group (p = 2.5e-4, OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24&#8212;0.65). Rs2237717 was one of three SNPs in the haplotype block to survive correction with permutation (p = 0.002), with 37.9% of the cases and 49.6% of the controls showing the ancestral allele (C). The ancestral allele is thus considered a protective allele against schizophrenia. This test was replicated by the authors using a dominant model and the results remained significant (p = 0.001). These results represent the first report of an association between MET and schizophrenia and the second of an association of MET with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric illness (autism, . ===General cognitive ability===They also reported that the MET haplotype which was inversely correlated with schizophrenia (&#8216;Block 3&#8217; containing rs2237717) had a significant impact on neurocognition. Carriers of the major allele at rs2237717 in the comparison group performed significantly better than non-carriers on a test of general cognitive ability.==Association with facial emotional perception==Another study by Lin et al  showed the rs2237717 SNP is associated with facial emotional perception.  The CT and CC genotypes enhanced facial emotional perception as compared to those with the TT genotype (ANOVA p = 0.016 and GLM p = 0.018, controlled for age, gender, and education). There was also an interaction of rs2237717 with rs1130233 in the AKT gene in the same signaling pathway, in which the rs2237717 C carrier/ rs1130233 G carrier group showed better facial emotional perception than those with the TT/AA genotype (ANOVA p = 0.035 and GLM p = 0.015), controlled for neurocognitive functions. According to the authors, this is the first study to suggest that genetic factors can affect performance of facial emotion perception.==Association with chronic rhinosinusitis==The MET gene has been implicated in nasal polyp development , and Castano et al  showed that the minor allele at rs2237717 is associated with chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with nasal polyps (genotypic P nominal = 0.09, empirical P = 0.04, OR = 1.4, CI = 1.0-1.9).

According to these results, the presence of the G allele in the patient associated with the incidence of cGvHD (p=0.002) and patients homozygous to the A allele had an increased risk of relapse (p=0.02). In contrast to HLA-E molecules, which are ligands for inhibitory NK receptors, MICA is ligand for activating NKG2D receptors. Patient who are homozygous for a valine at residue 129 of MICA are at higher risk of chronic GvHD after HLA-matched sibling HCT in comparison to patient who have a methionine at this position. This risk was independent of acute GvHD, suggesting that the residue 129 play a role in alloimmune responses and thus maybe protective against GvHD, (Boukouaci W, et al. 2009). MICA mismatching between patient and donor has a great influence on the clinical outcome because of the fact that MICA is polymorphic with over 84 recognized unique alleles (). According to two studies done to evaluate the role of mismatching MICA genes and risk of acute GvHD, it was shown that MICA mismatching was associated with an increased risk of grades II-IV acute GvHD but not grades III-IV acute GvHD in both HLA matched and mismatched transplant, and that was correlated notably with the GvHD of the GI tract (P=0.05).

MIR4761,Rs4680,"rs4680 (Val158Met) is a well studied SNP in the COMT gene. The COMT gene codes for the COMT enzyme, which breaks down dopamine in the brain's prefrontal cortex.  The wild-type allele is a (G), coding for a valine amino acid; the (A) substitution polymorphism changes the amino acid to a methionine.  This alters the structure of the resultant enzyme such that its activity is only 25% of the wild type.  As a result, A allele carriers have more dopamine in their prefrontal cortex, which may be responsible for many of the neuropsychological associations listed below./ 23andMe blog summarizes the alleles at this SNP as rs4680(A) = Worrier. Met, more exploratory, lower COMT enzymatic activity, therefore higher dopamine levels; lower pain threshold, enhanced vulnerability to stress, yet also more efficient at processing information under most conditions rs4680(G) = Warrior. Val, less exploratory, higher COMT enzymatic activity, therefore lower dopamine levels; higher pain threshold, better stress resiliency, albeit with a modest reduction in executive cognition performance under most conditionsRoughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at ) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.Specific studies include:rs4680, a functional Val/Met polymorphism, showed modest association with Irish familial schizophrenia.

MMP3,Rs3025058,"SNP rs3025058 was first described in 1995 as a variant upstream of, and influencing the regulation of, the MMP3 gene. Most commonly, the version of this SNP with a run of 5 A's is called the 5A allele, and an allele with 6 A's is called 6A. Thus, the homozygous genotypes are either 5A/5A or 6A/6A, and the heterozygote genotype is published as 5A/6A. Incidentally, the MMP3 gene is also called stromelysin-1, and although there is a SNP in dbSNP in the orientation that shows the polynucleotide run as A's (rs35068180) the entry that has population frequency data is the one discussed here, rs3025058, which is from the other strand and thus shows the string as T's.There have been numerous studies in the last 10+ years linking either the 5A or 6A allele to risk for myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease. A relatively recent meta-analysis combining seven previously published studies concluded that the 5A allele is indeed a plaque-disrupting risk factor (odds ratio 1.26, CI: 1.1 - 1.4, p<0.001), while the 6A allele is associated with greater progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the 6A/6A genotype is associated with a worse progression of coronary artery disease after angioplasty. However, all these studies show a lot of heterogeneity, and gender, age, and ethnicity are all likely to alter the influence of these alleles.  rs1799864(G), rs3025058(A) and rs662 were associated with increased risk, and rs1800775(A) with reduced risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism no influence on varicose veins",3241

This was derived by noting that a man with an ApoE allele has an AD odds ratio of 3.0 if they don't also have an rs2333227(T) allele, and an odds ratio of 11.4 if they do.  A study of 148 Italian sporadic AD patients yielded an odds ratio for the rs2333227(C;C) genotype (as oriented in dbSNP orientation) of 1.78 (CI: 1.13-2.80).

MSH3,Rs70991108,"rs70991108 is a polymorphism consisting of a 19-bp deletion in the first intron of the dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene. The wild-type (non-deletion) allele is a bit more common than the deletion allele in most populations. Several studies have linked this SNP to alterations in folic acid (and folate) metabolism. A study of 1,215 subjects  from the Framingham Offspring Study concluded that rs70991108 influences the prevalence of circulating folic acid levels. Specifically, folic acid intake over 500ug/d led to high circulating (unmetabolized) folic acid levels in subjects homozygous for the deletion genotype. When folic acid intake was under 250ug/d, the deletion/deletion homozygotes had lower RBC folate (732.2 nmol/L) compared with the non-deletion genotype (844.4 nmol/L). A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs70991108 deletion allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~4.6x for heterozygous and homozygous rs70991108 deletion genotypes, respectively (p=0.05). If a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele was also a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).Studies have also looked for connections between this SNP and the risk of having a baby born with spina bifida, but the results are inconsistent between studies:  PMID 14735580, PMID 15755837: suggested the del/del genotype increased risk for spina bifida and pre-term delivery  : suggested that the del/del genotype actually reduced risk for spina bifida  : found no connection whatsoever between the del/del genotype and spina bifida risk",1606

A study in Quebec showed an association in children with mutations in MTHFD1 having increased risk for heart defects, possibly in a folate status dependent manner (IE more so if their mother was not getting enough folate during pregnancy). A 2014 meta-analysis of nine studies totaling 4,302 cases of children born with neural tube defects concluded that Caucasian mothers carrying rs2236225(C;T) or rs2236225(T;T) alleles were at increased risk, of about 1.5 - 1.7x, of having affected children compared to mothers with no (T) alleles.

MTHFR,Rs1801133,"rs1801133 is a SNP that is relatively common and has been studied for (relatively) a long time. Also known as C677T, Ala222Val, and A222V, it encodes a variant in the MTHFR gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in folate drug metabolism|metabolism. Homozygous rs1801133(T;T) individuals have ~30% of the expected MTHFR enzyme activity, and rs1801133(C;T) heterozygotes have ~65% activity, compared to the most common genotype, rs1801133(C;C). ""/ Our Take on The MTHFR Gene,"" is a 23andMe blog posting (January 5, 2017), a meta-analysis finding that the past two decades of scientific evidence as it relates to specific MTHFR-influenced health conditions to be inconclusive or conflicting, with two exceptions, 1. women with two copies of C677T variant, 2. a very rare variant that may cause homocystinuria. Their takeaway, ""Based on the existing data, scientists at 23andMe have concluded that people should not interpret their genotypes at the common MTHFR variants as having an effect on their health.""This reduced activity (i.e. this SNP) has been linked at least once to each of the following disorders (though not necessarily reproducibly):  autism  cancer, including   gastric cancer   lung cancer   head and neck cancer   renal cancer  cleft lip and cleft palate  coronary artery disease  dementia  depression  hyperhomocysteinemia  migraine  neural tube defects  pre-eclampsia (gestational hypertension)  schizophrenia  thrombosis  down syndromePubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking rs1801133 to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in  this article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. Another meta-analysis of three studies on rs1801133 stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).rs1801131 and rs1801133 have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.Based on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the rs1801133(T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).A study of 677 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for rs1801133(T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001).

A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs1801133(T) allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~5x for heterozygous and homozygous rs1801133(T) genotypes, respectively (p=0.028). If a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele was also a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).'''Note:''' Another SNP in dbSNP, rs59514310, represents the same location as rs1801133.  rs1801133(T;T) post-menopausal women said to be at 2x higher risk for osteoporosis.

MYBPC3,Rs11570112,"rs11570112, also known as c.2992C>T, p.Gln998Ter and Q998X, represents a rare mutation in the MYBPC3 gene on chromosome 11. For multiple reasons discussed below, interpretation of the impact of this SNP is highly problematic.In addition to the reporting discrepancies between two different DTC labs (AncestryDNA and 23andMe) discussed below, the ClinVar record is decidedly mixed about whether this is, or is not, a pathogenic mutation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. After initially being classified of uncertain significance in 2011 by LabCorp, it was classified as benign in 2013 by both an NIH lab and by GeneDx, but in 2014, GeneDx re-classified it as pathogenic. Furthermore, in a dissertation published in July 2015 for a Masters in Genetic Counseling , rs11570112 was discussed in depth as a variant with conflicting interpretation between ClinVar and labs in the SHaRe academic consortium specializing in cardiomyopathy diagnosis /, citing one group as saying it was benign and the other of uncertain significance.AncestryDNA seems to report the common genotype for this SNP on OpenSNP as C,C on the plus strand, which shows up as G,G on the minus strand in Promethease.  23andme seems to report the common genotype for this SNP as GG on the plus strand, which shows up as C,C on the minus strand on Promethease.  This is an ambiguous flip (C/G).  Th first 10 or so C,C checked on OpenSNP were all AncestyDNA reports, and given the extremely low frequency of the pathogenic allele, this is most likely an ambiguous flip problem.  AncestryDNA users with a homozygous ""pathogenic"" GG reported by Promethease seem more likely to be wild type.  Additionally, both C,C and G,G are far more common on OpenSNP than C,G, which deviates from Hardy-Weinberg.  Additionally, newer 23andme (v4) microarrays do not seem to report any data for this SNP at all.",3411

MYH15,Rs3900940,"rs3900940 is a SNP in the MYH15 gene. The risk allele in terms of heart disease is rs3900940(C).This SNP is one of the 5 used by Celera's genetic risk score (GRS) for coronary heart disease (CHD). rs20455, in the KIF6 gene rs3900940, in the MYH15 gene rs7439293, in the PALLD gene rs2298566, in the SNX19 gene rs1010, in the VAMP8 geneFor each of the five variants, the GRS was increased by 1 if the subject was homozygous for the risk variant, unchanged if heterozygous, and decreased by 1 if the individual did not carry the variant. Therefore, individuals carrying all 10 possible risk variants (two copies of each of the five SNPs) were assigned a GRS of 5 and those carrying no risk variants a GRS of -5. A high GRS was defined as 3 or higher. Approximately 4% of the white cohort in ARIC was classified as high risk, and the hazard ratio for CHD after adjustment for traditional risk factors was a significant 1.57 (CI: 1.21-2.04; p<0.001). The results did not reproduce for African American participants.",3413
MYH6,MYH6 c.2161,"Icelanders with two copies of the rare T allele at SNP in the MYH6 gene, also known as c.2161, have an increased risk of sick sinus syndrome (SSS), also known as sinus node dysfunction. No rs# has yet been assigned to this location. SSS is a group of disorders that affect heart rhythm.MYH6 c.2161C>T was discovered in a GWAS published in March 2011 .  The discovery phase included 792 Icelandic cases with 37,592 Icelandic controls.  The SNPs with the strongest associations with SSS were rs2231801, rs28730774 and 14-22399934.  Since rs28730774 was the most significant SNP on the HumanOmni1-Quad chip (p = 1.6E-11; OR = 3.49; minor allele frequency = 0.01), it was studied further. In the second phase of the study, 7 chip-typed Icelandic cases (4 with the rs28730774 SNP) and 80 chip-typed Icelandic controls were subjected to whole genome sequencing.  In this analysis, the MYH6 c.2161C>T variant had the strongest association with SSS.  The mutation is located in exon 18 of the MYH6 gene and leads to an arginine to tryptophan amino acid alteration at amino acid 721.       In a follow-up validation study, the odds-ratio was calculated as OR = 12.95 with a p-value = 3.8E-5.  No homozygotes were identified.  Additionally, 184 Danish, 94 Dutch and 1498 US controls were compared to 135 US SSS cases, and no carriers of MYH6 c.2161C>T were found. The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome was reported to be around 6% for non-carriers of c.2161C>T but approximately 50% for carriers of this (c.2161C>T) variant.  alpha-MyHC is also associated with a 4.16-beat per minute decrease in heart rate (p=0.0019).The minor allele (T) results in a missense mutation in the ''MYH6'' gene, encoding the alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MyHC) protein.  This protein is a fast ATPase present mainly in atrial tissue.  The p.Arg721Trp variant resides in part of the converter domain of alpha-MyHC and is important for amplifying structural rearrangements of myosin during contraction.  This variant has been predicted to result in structural alterations .       As of May 2011, no frequency data are available.",3414
MYH6,Rs365990,"rs365990 is a nonsynonymous SNP in exon 25 of the ''MYH6'' gene, coding for the alpha myosin heavy chain (alpha-MyHC) protein.  The A->G nucleotide change results in the A1101V missense mutation in alpha-MyHc.   rs365990 was discovered in a study conducted by deCODE Genetics  as being most significantly associated primarily with heart rate, but also with PR interval.  In the Icelandic cohort of ~10,000 individuals in the discovery phase and an additional ~10,000 individuals in the follow-up phase, the rs365990 G allele frequency was 0.34, and the G allele was associated with decreased heart rate (p=9.4E-11 for both phases combined) and with a prolonged PR interval (p=1.8E-5 combined).  After adjusting for heart rate, the association of rs365990 with PR interval maintained significance (p=0.0027 combined).  rs365990G is associated with a 0.91-beat decrease in heart rate per minute .  This was replicated in a meta-analysis of 38,991 individuals of European descent, where the A allele of rs452306 was found to be associated with with a 0.58bpm decrease in resting heart rate per A allele .  rs452306 is in linkage disequilibrium with rs365990 (r2=0.96 in HapMap CEU), and it was suggested that rs365990 is the functional variant.    It was not, however, associated with atrial fibrillation (p=0.14 combined), pacemaker (p=0.13 combined), sick sinus syndrome (p=0.18 combined), or advanced AV block (p=0.33 combined).",3415

NCAN,Rs1064395,"rs1064395 is a single nucleotide variant (SNV) found in the neurocan gene (NCAN) that has been implicated as a predictor of both bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia. BD is characterized by a fluctuation between manic episodes and severe depression.  Schizophrenia is characterized by hallucinations, both visual and auditory, paranoia, disorganized thinking and lack of normal social skills.  NCAN is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is involved in cell adhesion and migration.  It contains 14 exons and spans 41 kb of the genome at the location 19p12. OMIM It has also been found that, in mice, this gene is expressed in a localized way in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain which are responsible for cognition and regulation of emotions. In 2011, a study by Cichon et al identified rs1064395 in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for Bipolar Disorder (BD).  This study was done by analyzing around 500,000 autosomal SNPs and 12,000 X-chromosomal SNPS in 682 patients with BD and 1300 controls. The patients studied were from Europe, the USA, and Australia.  The study then went forward to test the top 48 hits from their initial GWAS with an independent cohort of 1729 cases and 2313 controls, which narrowed down their significant hits to a list of eight.  These eight were then used in a meta analysis.  The rs1064395 was highly significant with a p-value of 3.02X10-8 and an odds ratio of 1.31, with A being the risk allele. The authors then further validated with a much larger sample size (6030 cases and 31,749 controls) and found a p-value of 2.74X10-4 and an odds ratio of 1.12 which, combined with their previous study lead to an overall p-value of 2.14X10-9 and an odds ratio of 1.17. In 2012, a study by M&#252;hleisen et al investigated this same SNP in case control studies involving schizophrenic patients. They designed a patient-control study using samples from patients with European ancestry.  The initial study included a cohort of 5061 patients and 9655 controls.  The risk A-allele was found more frequently in schizophrenic patients then in controls with a p-value of 2.28X10 -8 and an odds ratio of 1.11.  They followed up this initial experiment using a independent cohort from the Schizophrenia Psychiatric GWAS Consortium that included 5537 patients and 8043 controls. This follow up inquiry yielded a p-value of 0.0239 and an odds ratio of 1.07.  Thus, these authors concluded that, not only is rs1064395 predictive of BD, it is also predictive of schizophrenia.",3475

In a large GWAS of individuals of European descent published in March, 2011, rs2228603 was found to be associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as evidenced by hepatic steatosis found by CT scanning and confirmed by histology.  The investigators confirmed their initial findings with using the same case cohort and two separate control groups and found genome-wide significant odds ratios of 1.65 (95% CI = 1.15-2.87; p=5.29E-5; p=6.82E-10) and 1.9 (95% CI not reported) NAFLD is associated with higher LDL-C and lower LDL-C levels as well as impaired fasting glucose and increased risk of insulin resistance and diabetes.

The primary endpoint was either fatal heart disease or a heart attack.The blood pressure after six months of rs5065(G;G) patients (note: genotype is in dbSNP orientation, not as published) was lower if the patients were treated with diuretics compared to other medications, with smaller variation seen for (A;A) genotypes. The authors noted that none of the findings retained statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons, but since the trend held in five of seven outcomes, they felt the results were nonetheless worth reporting. In summary, rs5065(G) allele carriers were better off (i.e. experienced more favorable cardiovascular disease outcomes) if treated with the diuretic (in this case, chlorthalidone), whereas rs5065(A;A) carriers were better off if treated with the calcium channel blocker (in this case, amlodipine).",3575

Given a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy frequency of about 1 in 500 people in general across most populations (including African-Americans), this argues that either the penetrance of the R4344Q variant is very low or even that it is benign, although perhaps it might play a (minor?) role in the development of cardiovascular disease in a more general way and/or in the presence of certain environmental or biological stressors.",3632

Studies have demonstrated that individuals with the G allele are more empathetic, feel less lonely, employ more sensitive parenting techniques, and have lower rates of autism (discussed in )The blog / Not Exactly Rocket Science discusses that Americans with (G;G) tend to be more sensitive parents, more empathetic and less lonely than those with an &#8216;A&#8217;. In a Korean population people with (G;G) were less likely to seek support from their peers.  Culture, distress, and oxytocin receptor polymorphism (OXTR) interact to influence emotional support seeking. Oxytocin receptor genetic variation relates to empathy and stress reactivity in humans. In brief, people with the G;G genotype were better able to discern the emotional state of others than those who carried the A-allele (/ blog summary found here).  The study encompassed 192 participants of both sexes and mixed ethnicities. The study subjects underwent a number of tests to determine their level of empathy and stress reactivity. They found that G;G individuals performed significantly better on the behavioral measure of empathy and were 22.7% less likely to make a mistake on the ""Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test"" (RMET) (a behavioural measure of empathic accuracy) than A;A/A;G individuals (P = 0.005). Similarly, G;G individuals reported higher levels of dispositional empathy than A;A/A;G individuals: mean (SE) = 3.69 (0.06) and 3.53 (0.04) for G;G and A;A/A;G, respectively (P = 0.025), and were less affected by stress (as measured by their heart rates): mean (SE) = 72.1 (0.54) and 78.4 (1.19) for G;G and A;A/A;G, respectively. Associations between the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and affect, loneliness and intelligence in normal subjects. This study examined the association between the OXTR gene and parenting. A total of 176 mothers of toddlers were included in the study. After controlling for marital discord, depression, and education status, rs53576 was found to significantly correlate with parenting, with the G;G genotype being associated with a significantly more sensitive parenting style than A;A or A;G genotypes. However, they concluded that the major factor influencing parenting was the maternal education level. Forty-five female subjects (17 twin pairs and 11 twins without their sibling) were genotyped and tested for their ability to hear and understand conversations in noisy environments. Participants with the G;G genotype reported less difficulty hearing and understanding (difficulty hearing total score Mean (SD), 9.2 (4.2)) than participants with A;A/A;G genotypes (13.9 (3.8); p < 0.001). Even after adjusting for age, the relationship between genotype and difficulty hearing scores was still significant (p = 0.003). Two hundred three healthy German male university students (mean age 23.2 y, SD 2.9 y) were subjected to a mock interview and their saliva cortisol levels were tested before and at a number of time points after the interview. Half of the participants were told to bring a female friend as social support, whereas the other half came alone to the interview. The authors found that subjects carrying the G allele (G;G or A;G genotypes) had significantly lower cortisol responses to stress when they had social support (P < 0.01). Conversely, there were no differences in cortisol levels in subjects with the A;A genotype receiving or not receiving social support (P = 0.46). Moreover, there was a trend (P = 0.08) for people with the A;A genotype to display higher levels of cortisol throughout the session than G carriers (no differences between the genotypes were observed at baseline)./ 23andMe blog discusses the snp./ blogs.scientificamerican discusses the snp. In this study, 345 healthy subjects were examined by multimodal neuroimaging techniques to identify structural and functional alterations in OXTR risk allele carriers and their link to temperament. The authors found that there was a significant association between the different rs53576 genotypes and grey matter volume in the hypothalamus, with the hypothalamus volume being significantly larger in G;G carriers than in A;A carriers (P = 0.012). Moreover, they investigated the relationship between rs53576 and reward dependence (RD) using the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, and found that the G;G, G;A, and A;A genotypes were associated with the highest, intermediate, and lowest RD values, respectively (G;G vs. A;A, p=0.02; A;G vs. A;A, p=0.07). Lastly, they also demonstrated that rs53576 is associated with amygdala activation, with the A;A genotype being associated with a significant reduction in activation compared to the G;G genotype (p=0.036); and with the functional relationship between the amygdala and the hypothalamus, with A;A carrier having a significantly increased functional correlation (p=0.036). The authors concluded that there is likely a neural mechanism linking both structural and neural signalling alterations in the oxytocinergic system to individual differences in emotional reactivity and prosocial temperament. This study found that there is no association between rs53576 variants and the risk of autism in Caucasian children and adolescents.Followup:",3678

One explanation () suggests the following:  Caucasians have a different distribution of this SNP than do Hispanics and African Americans;  Having this SNP may be necessary, but is not sufficient, to cause fatty liver, as many individuals with the SNP have normal liver fat;  Probably this SNP does slow the export of fat from liver, but only rs7946 carrying individuals who also take in too many calories too quickly (i.e. overeat) will wind up with fatty livers.

The practice of Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India, is based on the concept of three major constitutional types (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) defined as “Prakriti”.

PGR,Rs1042838,"Minor allele (T) of this SNP uniquely identifies what is known as the PROGINS allele in the progresterone receptor gene PGR.Two SNP's tagging a partial haplotype of the PGR gene were associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer among homozygous carriers as compared with noncarriers: rs1042838 (PROGINS allele; odds ratio OR = 3.23, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.19 to 8.75, P = .022) and rs608995 (minor allele; OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.63 to 5.89, P<.001). The study suggest the effect is likely entirely due to rs608995, whose minor allele was almost always seen with PROGINS allele. For rs1042838, the risk allele in orientation to the corresponding dbSNP entry is (T). Subsequent studies have not replicated this high odds ratio, nor the apparent recessive model in this study. The small number of homozygous carriers in the study probably explains this outlier. A 2010 study  of 2888 cases and 4483 controls could not reproduce the association of this SNP with ovarian cancer, even adjusting for ethnicity and BMI. The study concludes their sample size had >90% power to detect OR 1.3 for this SNP, so if an effect exists it must be quite small. A pooled analysis of 4788 ovarian cancer cases and 7614 controls in 2008 suggested that PROGINS risk is limited to invasive endometrioid subtype , to that effect a 2010 study found association with endometrial cancer  with same risk haplotypes as the earlier haplotype study on ovarian cancer. A 2014 metastudy  however did find association between PROGINS and ovarian cancer, but statistically significant only for Caucasians, those having never used oral contraceptives, and serous (endometrial) cancers, while another meta-study  looking at endometrial cancer specifically found association (OR 1.52-2.72, p = 0.0008-0.03) among European women in particular.This SNP has also been reported to be associated with migraine-associated vertigo (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0007). SNPs in genes involved in female hormonal pathways have been a subject of particular interest in the study of migraines because females appear to be more prone to migraines than males. Previous studies had suggested that the minor allele of this SNP might also influence breast cancer. However, a 2009 European study of 30,000 breast cancer cases, compared to 30,000 controls, found no association, or as they put it, ""persuasive evidence against an overall association between invasive breast cancer risk and (this SNP)"".

Second, such carriers were at 2.57x (CI: 1.64-4.02) increased risk for breast cancer if they were never postmenopausal hormone users.2013 meta-analysis suggested association of weak effect with female reproductive (breast, endometrial and ovarian) cancer for A allele (A: OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.063, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.001-1.129; AA+AG: OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.067, 95% CI&#8202;=&#8202;1.002-1.136).

In multivariate linear regression models, we found a significant interaction between complex carbohydrate intake as a continuous variable and PLIN 11482 G > A genotype for waist circumference (P = 0.002). By dichotomizing complex carbohydrate intake, we found significantly different effects across PLIN 11482G > A genotypes.

However, there are publications that clearly report the opposite.Studies finding greater heart disease risk associated with the Q192 (glutamine) form include:  : 2009 study involving 10 year follow up study of 800 patients reporting a hazard ratio of 1.71 (CI:1.0 - 2.8, p=0.03) per Q allele  : 2009 study of ~1400 patients undergoing coronary angiography at the Cleveland Clinic concludes that QQ192 patients have the lowest PON1 activity and have both an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.05; CI: 1.32-3.18) and of major adverse cardiac events (HR 1.48, CI: 1.09-2.03, p = .01). See also this  Table  : 2011 study of with coronary artery disease patients receiving a stent and taking clopidogrel concluded that QQ192 homozygous individuals had the highest risk for stent thrombosis (OR 3.6; p = 0.0003) and that their PON1 plasma activity, active metabolite plasma concentration and platelet inhibition were all lower compared to RR homozygotes.Studies finding greater heart disease risk associated with the R192 (arginine) form include:  : 2010 meta-analysis of 22 eligible studies (totaling 7384 cases/11,074 controls) yields a summary odds ratio for ischemic stroke of 1.10 per G allele (CI: 1.04-1.17)  : 2013 report on ~200 Saudis concludes that the RR genotype was associated with CAD risk (OR 2.2, CI: 1.4-7.4, p < 0.01)  : Perhaps the most striking finding with such an association was reported in Japanese patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). NIDDM patients with either one or two rs662(G) alleles had a 9 fold higher risk of coronary heart disease compared with rs662(A;A) NIDDM patients. 274 ovarian epithelial carcinoma cases and 452 controls. rs662 odds ratio 0.65 (CI: 0.44-0.95; p for allele-dose effect = 0.03) for ovarian cancer for women carrying the rs662(A) allele compared with women with the (G;G) genotype rs1799864(G), rs3025058(A) and rs662(G) were associated with increased risk, and rs1800775(A) with reduced risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism In a study of 461 participants in the HERITAGE cohort (172 African-American, 289 Caucasian), the combination of rs662 with rs854560 was found to significantly contribute to trait-anxiety scores.  The high trait-anxiety group included ""significantly more subjects homozygous to the Alzheimer's disease- predictive PON192 variant.""  The authors also cite another paper, , which found that this SNP affects PON's catalytic efficiency.  From the context, it appears that it is the ""R"" variant, or rs662(G), which corresponds to the higher trait-anxiety scores and reduced catalytic efficiency, though this is less explicitly stated than one might hope. No association between rs662 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was seen in this large meta-analysis.",3998
PON1,Rs705379,"rs705379, also known as -108C/T or -107C/T, is a SNP in the PON1 paraoxonase 1 gene.

PON1,Rs705381,"rs705381, also known as -161C/T and -162A/G, is a SNP in the upstream promoter region of the PON1 gene.  (The assumption of equivalence between these names is based on the results of searching for rs705381 in the  Variant Name Mapper.) In a study of 101 mostly Caucasian patients prescribed the atypical antipsychotic risperidone, carriers of a rs705381(C) allele were less likely to gain significant weight compared to rs705381(T;T) carriers, as assessed by physiogenomic analysis of corresponding weight profiles. Two other SNPs, rs8179183 and rs6837793, were also significantly associated with weight profiles in these patients. In a study of 461 participants in the HERITAGE cohort (172 African-American, 289 Caucasian), the combination of rs705381 with ""PON-126"" (RS ID unknown) were found to significantly contribute to trait-anxiety scores.  The authors also cite another paper, , which found that this SNP accounts for 2.4% of the variation in PON1 expression.  Which allele correlates  with increased trait-anxiety scores and/or reduced PON1 expression is unclear.HapMap frequencies for this SNP seem dubious.  They list rs705381(T;T) as being at or near 100% for the population groups reported by SNPedia.  However, the raw data at HapMap for this SNP are largely no-call (e.g. CEU: NN=87, TT=82, CT=3).  The other diversity studies listed at  dbSNP show C as the more common allele (e.g. AFD_AFR_PANEL: CC=47.8%, CT=39.1%, TT=13.0%).  Anecdotal data submitted by participants at 23andme also show C as being more common (CC=4, CT=1, TT=2).  The diversity data have therefore been removed until these discrepancies can be resolved.

PON1,Rs854560,"The snp is suspected of being somewhat confused as an ambiguous flip, because the ReferenceAllele of T has a HapMap freq of 15% in CEU. Also notable is that dbSNP shows RefSNP Alleles:A/C/G/T, and other bits that don't quite fit. While the text below is still of use, it is likely that some of the conclusions are reversed.rs854560, also known as L55M, is a SNP in the PON1 gene.  It codes for amino acid 55 (or 54, depending on the numbering) of the paraoxonase (PON) protein.  Variants of this SNP affect levels of PON protein and mRNA and are correlated with Heart disease, aspects of Diabetes including diabetic retinopathy, and trait-anxiety scores.  The apparently more favorable form, rs854560(T), encodes a methionine and lead to elevated levels of paraoxonase, which is generally a good thing. The variant, rs854560(A), encodes an leucine, leading to less paraoxonase activity.   '''Note:''' These alleles are typically reported in the context of the mRNA sense orientation, where the (A) encodes the methionine, and the (T) encodes the leucine. rs854560 as published in dbSNP is from the opposite strand and thus the allele designation is reversed compared to the literature. Frequency of rs854560(A) allele, and of rs854560(A,A) genotype, appears to increase incidence of diabetic retinopathy. rs854560(A;A) genotype predicts higher insulin resistance, bodyweight, triglyceride levels, and blood pressure, and therefore cardiovascular risk. rs854560(A) associated with increased common carotid artery intima-media thickness compared to rs854560(T) (p value for trend 0.03), suggesting that variation in the PON1 gene contributes to early atherosclerosis in children with familial hypercholesterolemia. 274 ovarian epithelial carcinoma cases and 452 controls. rs854560 odds ratio 0.53 (CI: 0.35-0.79; p for allele-dose effect = 0.01) for women carrying the rs854560(T) allele compared with women with the (A;A) genotype rs854560(A;A) homozygotes experienced a significant increase, while rs854560(T) carriers experienced a non-significant decrease in HDL-Lp-PLA(2) activity (p = 0.030 between groups), upon fluvastatin treatment for 6 months; this may have implications for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In a study of 461 participants in the HERITAGE cohort (172 African-American, 289 Caucasian), the combination of rs854560 (L55M or PON55) with rs662 (Q192R or PON192) were found to significantly contribute to trait-anxiety scores.  The authors also cite another paper, , which found that the atypical version of this SNP reduces PON protein and mRNA levels.  Which genotypes correlate with increased trait-anxiety scores and/or reduced PON levels is unclear.  This paper states that the typical ""L"" version is TTG, and the ""M"" substitution is ATG.  This may help clear up the ambiguous flip if neighboring base pair information were available from the other sources as well.

PPARGC1A,Rs7665116,"Rs7665116 is located in an intronic region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1A gene, which codes for the protein PGC-1&#945;. The PGC-1 &#945; protein is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, thermogenesis, and molecular mechanisms responsible for cellular respiration.  PGC-1 &#945; has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington&#8217;s disease, as mutant huntingtin protein in HD patients inhibits the PGC-1&#945; system. The G polymorphism of the rs7665116 SNP has been associated with a three to five year delay in the age of onset of Huntington&#8217;s disease relative to the wildtype A allele.The rs7665116 SNP is located at the 3&#8217; end of intron 2 of PPARGC1A, in a highly conserved region of the gene. Though the majority of the variance in age of onset of Huntington&#8217;s disease is explained by the length of the CAG repeat in the HTT gene, a small portion of the variance (~4.3%) in age of onset is explained by rs7665116.  The CAG repeat length is causative of Huntington&#8217;s disease, One study conducted on a cohort of 854 European individuals (401 cases and 453 controls) revealed that the G variant of the rs76651116 SNP was associated with a delay in HD onset (p=0.0389 in the additive model and p=0.0112 in the dominant model). The association was particularly strong in the Italian population of participants, which comprised 312 of the 854 individuals (p=0.0172 in the additive model and p=0.0045 in the dominant model). For the rest of the population, the association was not statistically significant. Further studies will be necessary to determine significance in non-Italian populations.  Another study was conducted on a cohort of 400 German patients to determine various genetic modifiers of Huntington&#8217;s disease in order to create a multivariable model explaining the variance in age of onset of the disease. The transcriptional factors nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) regulate the are also implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis, and SNPs in these genes, along with rs7555116,  can explain 4.8% of the additional residual variance in the age of onset of the loss of motor coordination symptom of Huntington&#8217;s disease through a gene-gene interaction model.  The exact mechanism for these interactions remains unknown, and the experiment has yet to be replicated and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing in order to more clearly explain how NRF-1, TFAM, and PGC-1 &#945; interact to affect Huntington&#8217;s age of onset.  In general, this study underscores role of impaired mitochondrial function in the pathogenesis of Huntington&#8217;s, suggesting that upstream transcriptional factors of PCG1-1 &#945; may be useful targets for treating HD. One study conducted on a cohort of 234 (155 controls and 79 cases) Huntington&#8217;s patients of Italian descent demonstrated that the age of onset increased  depending on the genotype of rs7665116. For patients with an A/A genotype, age of onset was on average 45.08 years, while A/G patients were 48.75, and G/G patients began to show symptoms at age 49.09.

In the subpopulation of low-risk bleeders with no ongoing clopidogrel treatment and no subsequential PCI operation, this SNP rs10306114 and a co-inherited SNP rs3842787 were statistically associated with bleeding: Again, eight SNPs tested, and for these two with rs10306114(G) and/or rs3842787(T) the increase in bleeding risk is OR=1.94-75.75 (95%) with expected value 12.1, p = 0.012). The confidence interval is wide indicating a small number of positives in the subpopulation, maybe one or two, and the paper had more than sixteen tests with no adjustment of p-values, which makes the test non-definitive (hence small magnitude).",4220

PXK,Rs6445975,"rs6445975 is located on chromosome 3p14.3 and corresponds to intron 4 in the PXK gene (Phox homology domain containing serine/threonine kinase) and is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PXK is expressed in a variety of tissues including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This SNP has also been implicated as being an important modulator of cancer cell growth . For the rs6445975 SNP, the ancestral allele is a T and the disease associated risk allele is a G.rs6445975 was first found to be associated with SLE in 2008 in women of European ancestry. The study included 720 women with SLE and 2,337 controls and showed strong evidence for association (P=7.1x10&#8211;9; OR=1.25) . Additionally, a study in 2010 found that many SLE SNPs including rs6445975 showed that an increase in genetic susceptibility to SLE was associated with early disease onset. . Other studies have shown no association of rs6445975 with SLE. A study of patients mainly of Mexican ancestry included 804 patients with SLE and 667 healthy controls and found no association (Odds ratio=1.077; 95% CI=0.8&#8211;1.45; P=0.622). Another study of 910 SLE patients and 1440 healthy controls from Chinese living in Hong Kong and 278 SLE patients and 383 controls from Thailand, also found no association of rs6445975 to SLE (P=0.36, OR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.93&#8211;1.21). . A study from 2009 investigated if rs6445975 was associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) because SLE and RA share a complex etiology. They found no association of several SLE SNPs with RA, including rs6445975 (OD=1.11; 95% CI=1.0&#8211;1.2). A study of SLE in the Chinese mainland population used 288 cases and 357 controls and showed that rs6445975 is not associated with SLE (P=0.969; OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.75&#8211;1.32). . Another study examined the association of rs6445975with SLE in 527 Korean patients with SLE and 517 healthy Korean control subjects. They found no association of the rs6445975 risk allele with SLE (OR= 1.06; P=0.57). A study investigated the link between SLE and a decreased breast cancer risk in a cohort of 3,659 breast cancer cases and 4,897controls of primarily European descent. They found a slight positive association with breast cancer for the G risk allele of rs6445975 (OR=1.0911; P=0.0097) but concluded an overall weak association of breast cancer with SLE. A recent study performed a meta-analysis of 13 separate studies and identi&#64257;ed an association between SLE and the G allele of rs6445975 in the overall population (OR=1.151, 95 % CI=1.086&#8211;1.291, P=1.8E-06). There was a signi&#64257;cant association between rs6445975 and SLE in Europeans (OR=1.198, 95 % CI=1.118&#8211;1.285, P=3.4E-07), but not in Asians as expected from other studies.  Currently there is no cure for SLE, but symptoms can be managed by immunosuppressant drug treatments such as cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Generally, SLE is more common in women than in men and SLE is associated with disease risk alleles of SNPs in the following genes: ITGAM, KIAA1542, PXK, FCGR2A, PTPN22 and STAT4. Additionally, SNPs in the HLA-DQA1 and IRF5 genes have been shown to have a protective phenotype in women of European ancestry but not Asian ancestry. Most of the GWA studies performed for SLE that have been duplicated, found their results to be reproducible after accounting for differences in populations such as Europeans and Asians. rs6445975 particularly, has been shown to affect Europeans but not Asians or Mexicans. Some other studies such as those performed on Mexican or African American populations have yet to be repeated and so reliable data is not currently available.",4259

RET,Rs2506030,"rs2506030 is a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in gene RET. Its ancestral/non-risk allele is A and derived allele G. RET (ret proto-oncogene) is a cadherin family member and encodes a receptor tyrosine kinases. Functionally, it is involved in neural crest development. It’s located on the plus strand at 10q11.2 of the human genome spanning over 50K bp. There are 21 exons in the gene and 2 isoforms. Other than Hirschsprung disease, mutations in this gene is also associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia And Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) or congenital aganglionosis is a developmental defect characterized by the absence of neuronal ganglia in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Patients can be classified into 3 sub categories based on the length of the colon: short segment, long segment, or total colonic aganglionosis (TCA). The incidence is roughly 15/100,000 in population of European descent and twice as high for Asians. HSCR is a non-Mendelian disease. Mutations in a few genes have been identified to be associated with HSCR: RET, GDNF, NRTN, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, ZEB2, PHOX2B, KIAA1279, TCF4, and L1CAM.rs2506030 was first identified by Charkravarti’s group in a family-based GWAS study published in 2015. A total of 220 European American trios with short-segment HSCR were recruited and their DNA genotyped using Affymetrix platform, resulting in 500,000 SNPs. Association was tested using case pseudo-control and rs2506030 is statistically significantly different in the two groups (p value 2.78 10^-15). Furthermore, the statistical significance was confirmed in a replication study of 429 more HSCR trios of all segment lengths (p value 2.02 10^-4, combined p value 4.44 10-15, odds ratio = 2.0). Note that rs2506030 is independent of another common RET SNP rs2435357, which is common in HSCR patients based on previous studies. They hypothesize that rs2506030 affects a RET enhancer. Another study by the same group further studied rs2506030 in HSCR patients. This study includes a population case control comparison as well as family based association testing. Comparing the allele frequencies in cases and controls, there was a significant difference between allele frequencies in rs2506030  (p value 4.7 10^-10). Similarly, there is significant statistical evidence (p value = 5.3 10^9) of higher frequency of risk allele homozygotes in cases. OR was estimated to be 1.8. In addition, TDT was performed in 254 trios and 72 duos and the risk allele is over transmitted to probands (p = 9.5 10^-6).",4313

RGS2,Rs4606,"In mice, the genetic locus best correlated to anxiety-related behaviour contains the 'regulator of G protein signaling 2' gene . In humans, SNPs in the equivalent RGS2 gene have now been studied to see if they are correlated to anxiety related disorders.In the first part of one study, 119 families including children underwent standard lab-based behavioural assessments of behavioural inhibition, defined as a heritable temperamental profile characterized by a tendency to be shy, avoident, and behaviourally restrained in situations that are novel or unfamiliar. Along with some other RGS2 SNPs, carriers of a rs4606(G) allele were 3 fold more likely to exhibit behavioural inhibition (CI: 1.31-6.84, p = 0.0026).In the second part of this study, 744 college undergraduates (228 men, 516 women) who had been genotyped completed a personality profile known as the NEO-E (introversion) association test. Consistent with the earlier results, the same RGS2 alleles associated with behavioural inhibition were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with introversion (but not neuroticism), including rs4606(G), rs6428136(G), and rs10801152(T).In the third part of this study, 55 female undergraduates were studied by fMRI (functional MRI) emotional processing tests. Carriers of SNPs rs4606(G) or rs10801152(T) showed increased insular cortex activation, a reflection of anxiety, in these tests.Based on these results, the authors predict that social anxiety disorder is the most likely anxiety disorder to be associated with SNPs in the RGS2 gene such as rs4606.   SNPs in the RGS2 gene, including rs4606, show association with childhood temperament, adult personality, and brain function. each rs4606(C) allele was associated with a 2x (p =.026) increased risk of generalized anxiety disorder. 173 patients with panic disorder (and 173 matched controls) of German descent analyzed, leading to the conclusion that rs4606(G) carriers were at ~2x increased risk for this disorder. Note that the (G) allele appears to be the minor (rarer) allele in this study.'''Note:''' given the conflicting reports over whether the (C) or (G) allele is implicated in anxiety-related disorders, Dr. Jordan Smoller was contacted to verify that the orientation was unambiguously reported in the various publications. He has confirmed that the reports truly vary in which allele is considered the risk allele; this may be an example of the ""flip-flop"" phenomenon .rs4606 has also been reported to be associated with the development of Parkinson's like symptoms in schizophrenia patients treated with various drugs, as follows: A replication study was performed in which extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were rated in 184 US patients with schizophrenia. This group (115 African Americans, 69 Caucasian) was treated for at least a month with typical antipsychotic drugs (n=45), risperidone (n=46), olanzapine (n=50) or clozapine (n=43). The minor (G) allele showed a protective effect against antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism (AIP), with an odds ratio for AIP among rs4606(G) carriers of 0.23 (CI: 0.10-0.54, p=0.001) for the overall sample./ blog discussion 121 consecutively hospitalized, psychotic patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-IV schizophrenia receiving treatment with typical antipsychotic medication (n=72) or typical antipsychotic drugs and risperidone (n=49) for at least 2 weeks were studied. After correction for multiple testing the only RGS2 SNP associated with development or worsening of parkinsonian symptoms was rs4606 (p=0.002). rs4606 modifies risk of postdisaster and lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms under conditions of high stressor exposure",4319

RNASEL,Rs3738579,"rs3738579 represents a SNP in the 5' UTR region upstream of the RNASEL gene. A study of patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the uterine cervix, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), and breast cancer found 1.5x-2x increased risk for all three cancer types for the rs3738579(T;T) genotype, while finding decreased risk (0.5x) for rs3738579(C;T) heterozygotes. rs3738579(C;C) homozygotes had 0.6x less risk for cervical cancer but increased risk for HNSCC (1.4x) and breast cancer (1.8x). Although statistics were not reported per genotype, a combination of data from all three cancer forms over all genotypes provided strong statistical evidence for rs3738579 as a cancer marker, with a p-value of 4.43x10(-5).Note that the research cited above was published over a decade ago, and there has been no follow-up or replication to our knowledge. It would be best to consider the research preliminary and perhaps of little to no clinical significance (until it is confirmed or replicated in a larger sample).",4330
RNASEL,Rs486907,"rs486907 is a SNP in the RNase L RNASEL gene that has been associated with cancer risk. The basic rationale behind most of these studies is that RNase L is responsible for deactivating RNA-based viruses that are associated with certain cancers, and therefore SNPs that lead to lower RNase L activity may lead to increased cancer risk. This SNP is also known as R462Q or Arg462Gln.In a study of prostate cancer patients, rs486907(A;G) heterozygotes were calculated to be at 1.5x increased risk, and rs486907(A;A) homozygotes 2x risk (p=0.007).This SNP was also associated with hereditary-prostate-cancer (HPC) predisposition with an odds ratio of 1.97 (p=0.07) in a study of 116 affected Finnish families.See also:",4331

RTEL1,Rs6010620,"'''rs6010620''' is a SNP associated with atopic dermatitis (AD).  Also known as eczema, AD is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin disorders with a prevalence estimated up to 20% in children and 3% in adults .  It is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease that likely involves various genetic factors.  The SNP rs6010620 locates on chromosome 20q13.33, at which there are eight genes &#8212; ''PRIC285'', ''STMN3'', ''RTEL1'', ''TNFRSF6B'', ''ARFRP1'', ''ZGPAT'', and ''LIME1'' &#8212;, within a single 200-kb LD block around rs6010620.  Among them, ''TNFRSF6B'' and ''ZGPAT'' might be the susceptibility candidates whose expressions correlate with the SNP as suggested by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis .  rs6010620&#8217;s association with AD was first identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) published in 2011, involving 491,905 autosomal SNPs in 1,012 cases and 1,362 controls from southern China followed by two replication studies &#8212; one with an additional 3,624 cases and 12,197 controls of Chinese Han ethnicity, the other had 1,806 cases and 3,256 controls from Germany .  rs6010620 showed evidence for AD association in both the combined Chinese population (minor/risk allele G; ''P'' = 3.00 &#215; 10-8; OR = 1.17) and in the German cohort (minor allele A; risk allele G; ''P'' = 2.87 &#215; 10-5; OR = 0.80).The association was subsequently validated in a two-stage GWAS meta-analysis carried out later (''P'' = 0.002; OR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.03&#8211;1.15) .  This GWAS involved 5,606 cases and 20,565 controls from 16 population-based cohorts of European descent in the discovery meta-analysis, and the ten most strongly associated new susceptibility loci were then examined in the replication meta-analysis encompassing an additional 5,419 affected individuals and 19,833 controls from 14 studies.The group which published the first GWAS in 2011 recently validated the association as well with 4,538 cases and 13,412 controls from multiple cities in the central and northern parts of China (''P''GG = 1.83 &#215; 10-7; OR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.23&#8211;1.58) .  rs6010620&#8217;s association with subphenotypes of AD was examined in this study, and the SNP showed significant protective effect for sporadic AD (''P''genotype = 0.01; ''P''Bonferroni = 0.006; OR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.43&#8211;0.83).  Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6B (TNFRSF6B) is an immune receptor that plays a regulatory role in suppressing cell death .  It has been shown that mRNA expression of serum TNFRSF6B in AD patients are higher than those in healthy individuals and control subjects with non-atopic inflammatory diseases .  ''ZGPAT'', on the other hand, encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type with G patch domain-containing protein (ZIP) that transcriptionally represses several singling cascades including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway .  EGFR is overexpressed in skin lesions of AD patients and inhibition of its signaling induces dysregulated chemokine profiles that augment skin inflammation .  Taken together, these results indicate that ''TNFRSF6B'' and ''ZGPAT'' are indeed plausible causal genes for AD, while further fine mapping and functional studies are still needed before an unequivocal conclusion can be made on the exact susceptibility genes at 20q13.33 .----/ 23andMe blog rs6010620 G 1.28 Glioma",4342

SLC6A4,Rs25531,"According to David Hinds of 23andMe on community forums, ""nearly everyone (99.97%) is getting called as CC, and there is no clear heterozygote cluster"" ... ""the genotype calls for rs25531 on our platform are not meaningful."" Looking at OpenSNP frequency data, this seems to be universal for direct to consumer genotyping services at this stage.The minor allele (G) of rs25531 is almost always in phase with the long (L) allele of the 5-HTTLPR, which is the most commonly studied variation in this region. The (L) long allele may be associated with lower levels of serotonin.The article and video from ""The Atlantic"" suggests that children with the short allele (A), may need and benefit greatly from more maternal support  contrast to earlier reports linking rs25531, a SNP in the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 gene, to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), a March 2007 publication finds no significant association studying ""the largest sample size of OCD patients (N=347) and controls (N=749) ever investigated"". A separate study of 75 patients suffering mood disorders after traumatic brain injury (TBI) concluded that there was no evidence of association between rs25531 and depression post-TBI.A small study (62 patients and 62 matched controls) investigated this SNP in relation to blushing. (Blushing is considered to be one of the prime pathophysiological markers of social anxiety disorder.) The less active 5-HTTLPR genotypes were nominally significantly associated with increased blushing propensity in patients with social anxiety disorder, and association remained significant even when statistically controlled for he influence of depression.A study of 94 depressed patients who attempted suicide compared to 94 without psychiatric disorders found no evidence of an association with rs25531.A study of 97 ""normal"" individuals concluded that rs25531(G;G) individuals selectively process positive affective material alongside selective avoidance of negative affective material, in a manner absent among individuals carrying a rs25531(A) allele. To put it another way, if this conclusion drawn from a very small sample of people can be replicated, rs25531(G;G) individuals may have a tendency to be optimists and to be more resilient to stress.A study published in 2011 of 2,500+ individuals followed from 1995 - 2008 as part of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health found that twice as many respondents with two 5-HTTLPR long variants said they were very satisfied with life compared with carriers of two short versions. Conversely, 26% of those carrying two short alleles said they were dissatisfied with life, compared with 20% of people carrying two long variants. This  blog post investigates the statistics.A study of 135 patients with major depressive disorder (mean age 31.1+/-11.6 years, 68% females) treated with escitalopram 10-20 mg/day for 12 weeks concluded that patients carrying the rs25531(A) allele may be at increased risk for side effects (e.g. headaches), but they say no associations with efficacy.

The most common nucleotide or 'major allele' of this SNP is G, which is also the dominant allele. The minor allele is A, which according to data from the 1000 Genomes project occurs in the sampled population at a frequency of 15.8% (observed 345 times in 2183 people). HapMap data (July 2005) from 1208 individuals from 13 populations included population specific genotype frequencies for this SNP  dbSNP.A 2011 study published by Li ''et al.'' examined 33 SNPs in 13 TGF-beta pathway genes to estimate the effect of genotype on brain metastasis in 116 NSCLC patients. The authors found that NSCLC patients with the G/G genotype of the rs12913975 SNP had a significantly increased risk of brain metastasis compared to patients with the A/G genotype over the two years following initial time of lung cancer diagnosis (hazard risk: 2.540, 95% confidence interval: 1.204-5.359, p = 0.014). Hazard ratios and confidence intervals were estimated using cox proportional hazards model for the multivariate survival analyses adjusted for sex, age, clinical stage, tumor histology, Karnofsky performance status, and smoking status. A two-tailed t- test was used to determine significance of associations. This finding may allow clinicians to use the rs12913975 SNP as a measure of an NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of developing brain metastasis. It is not known whether this SNP plays a functional role in the potential of NSCLC tumors to metastasize to the brain. However, the SNP is located in the SMAD6 gene, an inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling that is a pathway affected in different cancers, so this may in fact be a functional variant  PMID: 23284751.In 2011 Lin ''et al.'' determined the effect of genotype on survival in 598 advanced-stage NSCLC patients across 227 SNPs in 23 TGF-beta pathway-related genes to estimate. The authors identified the rs12913975 SNP as a genetic variant significantly associated with the overall survival of NSCLC patients (hazard risk: 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.59, p = 0.01). Furthermore, they found that the G/G allele of this SNP had a significant positive effect on the survival of NSCLC patients using chemoradiation (hazard risk: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.90, p = 0.01), but that this trend was not significant when patients used only chemotherapy (hazard risk: 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.56-1.02, p = 0.29). Hazard ratios and confidence intervals were estimated using cox proportional hazards model for the multivariate survival analyses adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, clinical stager, pretreatment PS, and therapy modality.

SMAD7,Rs736839,"rs736893 is related to sickle cell anemia, a genetic disease in which red blood cells form an abnormal crescent shape as opposed to the normal disc shape /. In the United States, it's estimated that sickle cell anemia affects 70,000&#8211;100,000 people, mainly African Americans. A New England Journal of Medicine study conducted in the US reported an average life expectancy of 42 in males and 48 in females . The landmark 1949 Science paper titled "" Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease by Pauling established the molecular basis for this sickle cell anemia and introduced notions that will become central to molecular medicine.  Sickle cell leg ulcers are common complications of sickle cell anemia . As of 2010, despite the fact that this complication has been recognized since the early times of sickle cell disease, there has been little improvement in the efficacy of its management and clinical outcome over the past 100 years . In a  study, investigators found significant associations between rs736839 (18q21.1) and sickle cell leg ulcers. Using the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm to control FDR, this SNP was the only one found with FDR under 10%. In this study, the odds ratio for rs736893 was 1.95, with 95% confidence interval of (1.35&#8211;2.82). Homozygous C is associated with elevated levels of risk for sickle cell leg ulcers. In contrast, having at least one of T is considered less risky. This case-control study involved 387 cases and 920 controls. The genotype associations were adjusted for sex and age because men and older individuals are more likely to be afflicted .Although not in a gene, rs736839 is adjacent to SMAD7, which is part of the Transforming Growth Factor&#8211;b/Bone Morphogenetic Protein (TGF-beta/BMP) pathway. In a separate case-control SNP association study, IGF1R and genes in the TGF-beta / BMP pathway has been linked to sickle cell anemia .The Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions. In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGF-beta signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGF-beta superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.

SNCA,Rs2736990,"rs2736990 is a SNP associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degradation of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra.  Rs273990 is located on chromosome 4q22 in the synuclein-alpha SNCA locus. The function of SNCA is not fully understood, but it predominately found in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, and it is thought that it plays a role in maintaining adequate supplies of synaptic vesicles.  SNCA is also a major component of Lewy Bodies (LB), protein accumulations often found in neurons in patients with PD.The best evidence for the association of rs2736990 with PD was provided in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that found an increased frequency of the minor C allele (T is the major allele) in position 90897564 among cases compared to controls.   The study first identified this SNP in a pool of 1,713 cases and 3,978 controls of European ancestry.  The researchers then successfully replicated this significant finding in a separate group of 3,361 cases and 4,573 controls, also of European ancestry.   Estimates of effect size and statistical significance from the pooled dataset (which incorporates both groups) are as follows: OR = 1.23, p = 2.24 x 10-17 .   Several other studies have also examined the relationship between rs2736990 and PD. A group of Japanese researchers conducting a GWAS on 2,011 cases and 18,381 controls of Japanese descent found a significant association of rs2736990 with PD that survived Bonferroni correction (p-value not reported) .  Another group looked at only the rs2736990 SNP in 515 cases and 450 controls of Chinese descent and found the minor C allele was significantly more frequent in patients with PD (OR=1.26, p = 0.017).  Other studies have validated the association between rs2736990 and PD in European populations:  The Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center tested rs2736990 only in 344 cases and 275 controls and found a significant association (OR = 1.40, p = 0.0032); another group combined data from previous GWAS studies with their own data to create a GWAS dataset of 1752 cases and 1745 controls that yielded a significant association (OR = 1.29, p = 6.7 x 10-8) ; finally, a GWAS conducted on 772 cases and 2024 controls of Dutch descent found a significant association between rs2736990 and PD (OR = 1.325, p = 1.63 x 10-5). It is not known with certainty how mutations in synuclein-alpha contribute to PD; however, mutations in this gene, both missense and copy number variants, have been linked to the development of PD. In addition, rs2736990 is one of several SNP&#8217;s in the SNCA locus significantly associated with PD in GWAS studies, and the significant association of this SNP with PD has been replicated and validated in several subsequent studies.  Moreover, estimates of effect size are similar across studies.  As such, the biological plausibility of this mutation appears high.  One candidate mechanism for development of PD due to SNCA hypothesizes that misfolded or excessively produced synuclein-alpha proteins accumulate in the neuron and interfere with normal function until they eventually cause death. This theory is supported by the abundance of synuclein-alpha proteins in LB&#8217;s found in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.  However, it is unclear if these LB&#8217;s are a response to injury or themselves the cause of death. Linkage disequilibrium patterns and tagSNP transferability among European populations.

The rs4880(C) allele gives rise to an alanine at this position is it also known as Val16Ala manganese superoxide dismutase, or A16V. There appears to be some conflict in the literature over the effect of this SNP. Having a valine at codon 16 is said to reduce enzyme activity , and thus lead to increased oxidative stress, yet in at least one study of the actual enzyme levels measured in people, SOD2 activity was 33% higher in (C;T) or (T;T) individuals compared to (C;C) individuals . Regardless of how this resolves, several phenotypic associations have been reported for this SNP, including:  A 10 fold higher risk for heart disease in hereditary hemochromatosis patients with rs4880(T;T) genotypes compared to similar patients with rs4880(C;T) or rs4880(C;C) genotypes.   An increased risk of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) was found in individuals with rs4880(C;C) (OR = 3.07, CI: 1.55-6.05) genotypes. Odds ratios for developing mesothelioma were even higher for patients lacking obvious exposure to asbestos fibers.   Among prostate cancer patients with a rs4880(T;T) genotype, but not the (C;C) genotype, higher iron intake level was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in risk for aggressive forms of the cancer (OR=2.3, CI: 1.0-4.9).  rs4880(C;T) prostate cancer patients being treated by radiation therapy are more likely (8% compared to 0%, p=0.02) to exhibit a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding after irradiation than (C;C) or (T;T) patients, based on a study of 135 patients. The odds for this are worse if the patient also has the rs861539(C;T) genotype (14% vs 1%, p=0.002).

SOD3,Rs1799895,"rs1799895, also known as c.691C>G, p.Arg231Gly and R231G, is a SNP in the SOD3 gene on chromosome 4.About 2-3% of the population carries a rs1799895(G) allele, which has been associated with lowered risk for lung disease (COPD; ~0.5x) yet higher risk (~1.5x) for ischemic heart disease.Based on studies in mice, this paradoxical effect appears to be related to preferential distribution of the variant extracellular SOD enzyme from lung and vascular tissue to extracellular fluid. This redistribution is hypothesized to be beneficial in alveolar lung disease but detrimental in pulmonary vascular disease.See also OMIM  185490.0001",4813

SORCS2,Rs10937823,"rs10937823 is a SNP associated with the gene SORCS2, variants of which may play a role in bipolar disorder. The allele most frequently occurring is C, and the variant is T. In the HapMap-CEU population, CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 0.894, 0.097, and 0.009, respectively. However, in the HapMap-CHB population, CT was the most frequently expressed genotype; CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 0.366, 0.439, and 0.195, respectively. In some sample populations, the TT genotype did not exist (TSI, MKK, LWK, ASW).   dbSNPThe SORCS2 (sortillin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 2) gene on chromosome 4p16.1 is found to be highly expressed in the mature human brain and kidney. High levels of expression are also seen in the brain during mouse development.   GeneCards This gene family is responsible for trafficking lysosomal enzymes that are modified within the Golgi to their packaging vacuole.   Sortillins have been found to facilitate neurotrophin binding to its receptor, which is necessary for mediating neuronal apoptosis, growth and survival. Given these roles, it has been proposed that alterations to the SORCS2 gene can lead to neuronal dysfunction. In 2008, a genome-wide association study indicated the SORCS2 gene in bipolar disorder. The study conducted by Baum et al. analyzed 461 affected individuals and 563 matched controls (from the National Institutes of Mental Health Genetics Initiative, all of European ancestry), and a replication sample of 772 affected individuals and 876 matched controls (affected individuals recruited from German hospital admissions, and controls recruited from a German census). The C allele of rs10937823 was found at a frequency of 0.949 in cases and 0.912 in controls in NIMH cohort (p=0.001); 0.954 in cases and 0.931 in controls in the German cohort (p=0.004). The resulting combined odds ratio was 1.67 between the German and NIMH cohorts.  Table 3 Furthermore, with multi-locus analysis, the authors found that the highest risk of bipolar disorder was associated with presence of both rs10937823 and rs1170191, a SNP in diacylglycerol kinase eta (DGKH  Rs1170191), suggesting that these SNPs have a combinatorial effect in conferring risk (p=1.2x10-8). A Finnish bipolar family study in 2009 replicated the association between rs10937823 and bipolar disorder. The researchers genotyped the 26 SNPs most strongly associated SNPs as found by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, and the aforementioned study by Baum et al. in 723 individuals from 180 families. The study classified individuals as falling into diagnostic classes of bipolar type I disorder (cases = 214; controls = 509) or a broad mood spectrum disorder encompassing all types of bipolar disorder (cases = 298; controls = 495). In an opposite finding to that of Baum et al., the minor allele (T) frequency in the unaffected individuals was 0.999; in cases, the frequency was 0.112. The lower frequency of the T allele of rs10937823 in cases versus controls was statistically significant (p=0.004187 using broad mood spectrum disorder; p=0.004703 using broad mood spectrum disorder). In 2011, In a Japanese cohort of 736 individuals, rs10937823 was again found to be significantly associated with bipolar disorder by Takata et al. (363 cases, 370 controls; p=0.0175). However, the results showed that the risk allele (more commonly associated allele in cases) was T, not C. The minor allele frequency in the bipolar disorder sample was 0.275, versus 0.253 in the control sample. An odds ratio for this SNP was not reported. In 2011, Cristoforou et al. identified an association between rs10937823 and bipolar disorder in a Scottish population (506 cases, 607 controls; p=0.031; OR not reported). Like the Japanese study by Takata et al., the minor allele (T) was found to be associated with bipolar disease.   Similar observations of this &#8220;flip-flop&#8221; phenomenon where opposite alleles appear to confer risk have been reported in other genes, such as COMT gene and schizophrenia, and GSTO1 gene and age of onset in Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease. The authors suggest that such different results could be due to allelic heterogeneity, the effects of multiple loci, or varying linkage disequilibrium amongst the subjects, if the findings across the studies and populations are indeed correct.",4816

TF,Rs1049296,"rs1049296, also known as Pro570Ser, is best known as the basis for the C1/C2 subtypes of the transferrin TF gene. The rs1049296(C) allele encodes the C1 subtype, and the rarer rs1049296(T) allele encodes the C2 subtype.Involved in the transport of iron,  transferrin and its subtypes have been linked at times to various conditions, perhaps most notably Alzheimer's disease. One meta-analyis of 19 studies with 6310 cases and 13661 controls concluded that the C2 allele, rs1049296(T), was associated with slightly increased risk for Alzheimer's, with odds ratios around 1.1-1.2. Pathogens may scavenge iron, and the body's attempts to sequester it from such pathogens are a form of defense termed nutritional immunity.

That means it doesn't change the nature of the TGF-β1 protein, but it does change the amount produced. The T version increases the amount of TGF-β1 produced, by preventing AP1 from binding to this region where in the C version it would normally downregulate production. That increased TGF-β1 production with the T version is probably what causes all the health effects of this SNP.  Whether increased TGF-β1 is good or bad probably depends on the disease you are interested in.It has been associated with increased risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The rs1982073(T) allele, generally associated with lower levels of TGFB1 protein production, has been associated with increased risk for the following: Allograft rejection   The rs1982073(T) allele is associated with increased risk for subclinical allograft rejection with an odds ratio of 6.7 (p = 0.02).  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)   Although smoking is the main risk factor, smokers with a rs1982073(T) allele (or two other TGFB1 SNPs, rs2241712 and rs1800469) were more likely to develop COPD, based on a study of ~700 Caucasian subjects.  Cytopenia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  rs1982073(T;T) homozygosity was associated with a severe degree of cytopenia (odds ratio 4.9, p = 0.0071) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), even though the genotype apparently does not predispose individuals to the disease.  Diabetes  A study of 400 Caucasians with type 1 diabetes found an increased risk for diabetic nephropathy for carriers of rs1982073(T) alleles.  Pre-eclampsia and stillbirth  Although not associated with the overall risk, among women who developed eclampsia/pre-eclampsia with severe renal and neurological complications or had neonatal deaths/still births, the rs1982073(T) allele was more likely in a relatively small study (< 100 patients).  Sarcoidosis and chronic beryllium disease  Although not associated with overall risk for developing the diseases, the rs1982073(T) allele was associated with the severity of granulomatous diseases such as chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and sarcoidosis, and a haplotype containing rs1982073(C) was protective against severe disease. On the other hand (strand?), the less common rs1982073(C) allele, generally associated with lower levels of TGFB1 protein production, has been associated with increased risk as follows: The rs1982073(C) allele was significantly more frequent in patients with two Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-related diseases, specifically, primary acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH), than in controls (p<0.001).  Alzheimer's disease  Both the rs1982073(C) allele and the (C;C) genotype were overrepresented in a study of ~200 patients compared to controls, independently of ApoE4 status. The (C;C) genotype was also overrepresented in patients progressing from MCI (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's, suggesting that TGFB1 may be an early marker of inflammatory mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's.  Brucellosis  A study of ~400 Iranian patients with brucellosis found that the rs1982073(C) allele was associated with increased risk.  Diabetes  A study of 400 Caucasians with type-2 diabetes determined that rs1982073(C) was associated with diabetic nephropathy, and even more strongly with diabetic retinopathy; the odds ratio patients with retinopathy but not nephropathy versus uncomplicated diabetes was 3.17 (CI: 2.17-4.63), and the different results between type-2 diabetes and type-1 diabetes were potentially ascribed to population differences.  Myopia  A study of 200 highly nearsighted Chinese Taiwanese found that people with the rs1982073(C;C) genotype were more likely to have high myopia compared to the (C;T) or (T;T) genotypes. The odds ratio was 1.83 (CI: 1.27-2.63, p<0.001).  Prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)  The rs1982073(C) allele was associated with a higher risk of developing prostate cancer as well as benign  prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a study of 175 Brazilian patients, with odds ratio compared to the population of 2.6x and 3.6x, respectively.

TNF,Rs1799724,"rs1799724, a SNP near the tumor necrosis factor TNF gene, was found in a study of ~500 Caucasians to be both an independent risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease and also a modifier of the risk for individuals carrying ApoE4 alleles. On its own, the rs1799724(T) allele led to an odds ratio of 1.63 (CI: 1.13-2.34, p=0.009). In carriers of ApoE4 alleles, the odds ratio changed from 2.92 (CI: 2.00-4.27) in the absence of rs1799724(T) to an OR of 6.65 (CI: 3.26-13.55, p=0.03) in its presence.

TNF,Rs1800629,"This SNP in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene, rs1800629, is also known as the TNF-308 SNP. Occasionally the rs1800629(A) allele is referred to as 308.2 or TNF2, with the more common (G) allele being 308.1 or TNF1. The (A) allele is associated with higher levels of TNF expression. This SNP has been linked to a wide variety of conditions:  Allograft rejection   Among 72 Polish patients receiving a kidney transplant, the risk of acute kidney allograft rejection was 2.5x higher among rs1800629(A) carriers compared to (G;G) homozygotes (CI: 1.19- 5.37, p<.05).   Asthma   A meta-analysis of ~2,500 patients combined indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele was associated with a 1.46x increased risk for asthma.    In a study of ~600 Mexican families and their asthmatic children, rs1800629(A) carriers had an increased risk of asthma (relative risk = 1.54, CI: 1.04-2.28), especially among children of non-smoking parents (odds then 2.06, CI: 1.19-3.55, p for interaction = 0.09).    In a study of Norwegian children, nonallergic asthma was associated with rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio 1.7, CI: 1.3-2.3).   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   A meta-analysis of 36 publications totaling ~5,000 patients concluded that the association between the rs1800629(A) allele and the risk of COPD was statistically significant for Asians (odds ratio 2.36, CI: 1.84 - 3.02, p < 0.0001) but not for Caucasians.  Crohn's disease   In a study of 235 Portuguese patients, the rs1800629(A;A) genotype was associated with higher susceptibility to Crohn's disease, with an odds ratio of 3.0 (CI: 1.2-7.2). These homozygotes also showed more disease-related complications.   Exfoliation glaucoma (XFG)   A study of 204 patients with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) concluded that rs1800629 is unlikely to be a major risk factor for XFG in Caucasians.   Graves' disease   A meta-analysis of 10 case-control studies, including over 2,200 Graves' disease cases, concluded that rs1800629(A) carriers were associated with this type of hyperthyroidism.   Heart disease   A study of 600 Italian patients concluded that rs1800629(A) carriers are at increased risk for acute heart attack and have other markers of heart disease. The odd ratio was 1.86, CI: 1.08-3.21, p=0.027).    A study of 50 Egyptian children with rheumatic heart disease found increased risk associated with the rs1800629(A;A) homozygotes, with odds ratio = 5.7, p<0.001. However, there was a significantly lower frequency of heterozygous genotypes.     However, a 2016 meta-analysis including 12 publications consisting of 6000+ cases found no significant association between rs1800629 and risk for myocardial infarction.  Ischemic stroke   A meta-analysis of 18 studies with 8075 patients found no significant association between ischemic stroke and the TNFα-308G/A, except potentially in a subgroup of East Asians.  Leprosy   A study of 37 Thai patients with leprosy found that the rs1800629(A) allele was more common (odds ratio = 2.69, p=0.04). PMID 17624216}  Liver disease   A study of 108 Chinese patients concludes that rs1800629(A) carriers are at 3.23x (CI: 1.10-9.44) increased risk for liver cancer and are also at higher risk for hepatic fibrosis and more severe liver damage.    Lymphoma   A study of 194 Tunisian patients indicated an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma among rs1800629(A;A) genotypes, at an odds ratio of 3.63, p=0.028.    A study of 441 incident non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases indicated that, compared with the wild-type rs1800629(G;G), the (A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk (odds ratio 2.14, CI: 0.94-4.85), whereas the (A;G) genotype was not. This association was similar for follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.    A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. Five SNPs in two cytokine genes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha, were associated with a 1.31x increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63; P = 0.01) and with a 1.64x increase in the subtype known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23-2.19; P = 0.0007). The other four SNPS are listed below. The cytokine genes affect inflammatory and innate immune responses.    rs361525    rs1799724    rs909253    rs2239704  Susceptibility to Mediterranean spotted fever   Although cytokine genes affect immune response to infection, in a Sicilian population the rs1800629 polymorphism did not affect susceptibility to Mediterranean spotted fever.   Migraine   Polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene may be associated with migraine and cardiovascular disease. The rs1800629 SNP has not been found significant.   Multiple sclerosis (MS)   A study of 300 Croatian and Slovenian patients indicated that rs1800629(A) carriers might be at lower risk for multiple sclerosis.   Nasal polyps   The rs1800629(A;G) genotype was associated with increased risk for nasal polyps in a study of 82 Turkish patients.     Another study found a nearly doubled risk for rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio, 1.86; confidence interval, 1.4-3.09).   Psoriasis   A study of 160 Polish patients indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele frequency was significantly decreased among patients with early-onset psoriasis (7.5% vs. 15.4%, p=0.022).    In contrast, 147 Irish patients with psoriasis were studied and the results indicated that the rs1800629(A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk as well as earlier onset of psoriasis.   Rheumatoid arthritis - response to TNF-alpha inhibitors   2009 meta-analysis of 9 studies concludes rs1800629(A) allele carriers respond less well to TNF-alpha inhibitors when being treated for rheumatoid arthritis.   Sarcoidosis   In a pooled analysis of seven case-control studies, the odds ratio for sarcoidosis for carriers of the rs1800629(A) allele was either 1.47 (CI 1.03-2.08 under a dominant model) or 1.39 (CI: 0.67-2.90; under a recessive model).   Susceptibility to sepsis   A study of 159 patients with severe trauma indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele was associated with higher risk of developing sepsis and of dying (odds ratio 7.65, two-sided p = 1.9 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). The authors of this research suggest that preemptive anti-inflammatory interventions should be developed for use in carriers of this SNP should they suffer severe injuries.    A meta-analysis of 25 studies concluded that while rs1800629 status is significantly associated with risk for sepsis, especially among Asians, it was not associated with mortality from sepsis. However, there may be an increased risk for fatal outcomes among Asians (odds ratio 10.75, CI: 3-39, p < 0.01).  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)   A study of 120 Columbian patients with SLE found an increased risk for rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio 3.9, CI: 1.65-5.80, p= 0.0004).    A meta-analysis of 21 studies indicated that in European populations, the rs1800629(A) allele is associated with increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In Europeans, the oodds ratio for the (A;A) genotype was 4.0, CI: 2.5-6.4, p<0.001. No association was detected in Asian-derived populations. The overall odds ratio for rs1800629(A) carriers was 2.0 (CI: 1.3-3.1, p<0.001).",5051

This SNP in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene has been linked to a wide variety of conditions:  Breast cancer   A large study of over 5,000 Caucasian women found that rs361525(A) allele carriers were at somewhat elevated risk for breast cancer compared to the (G;G) genotype, with an odds ratio per allele of 1.18, CI: 1.04-1.35, p(trend)= 0.008.   However, a 2009 European study of 30,000 breast cancer cases, compared to 30,000 controls, found no association, or as they put it, ""persuasive evidence against an overall association between invasive breast cancer risk and (this SNP)"".   Graft versus host disease (GVHD)   A study of ~100 allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients in Brazil concludes that graft versus host disease (GVHD) is about twice as frequent if either the donor or the recipient is a carrier of the rs361525(A) allele.   Otitis or ear infections   Children who are rs361525(G;G) homozygotes may be more prone to ear infections; adjusted odds ratio 2.29, p=0.03).   Nasal polyps   The rs361525(A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk for nasal polyps in a study of 82 Turkish patients.   Psoriasis   A study of 160 Polish psoriasis patients indicated that the frequency of the rs361525(A) allele was significantly increased (16.8% vs. 3.1%, p=0.000017, odds ratio 8.79, CI: 2.606-29.678), and furthermore, the onset age was lower in rs361525(A) carriers.   Diabetes and verbal memory   rs361525(A) carriers showed a slower decline of verbal memory over a period of 48 weeks in a study of elderly patients with type-2 diabetes.   Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)   rs361525(G;G) babies may be at higher risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) based on a relatively small number (148) of Norwegian infants studied.

TNNT2,Rs3729547,"rs3729547, is a SNP that was recently shown to be mildly associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  in the Han Chinese population and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Indian population.  . This SNP is located within  the coding sequence of the TNNT2 gene, which encodes a component of the troponin complex critical for proper sarcomeric contractility in cardiomyocytes, the cell type driving contraction in the heart. A number of earlier studies have shown that mutations in TNNT2 can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.    characterized by a thinning of the ventricular wall, or conversely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by a thickening of the ventricular wall. Both conditions lead to an overall weakening of the heart muscle and can lead to heart failure or sudden cardiac death.  The molecular mechanisms whereby mutations in the same gene (TNNT2) can lead to two diseases (DCM and HCM) with such contrasting phenotypes are still not well-understood. In a study by Li et al, rs3729547 (C to T) and another tagging SNP also in TNNT2, rs3729843 (G to A),  were shown to be associated with DCM in a cohort of Han Chinese individuals (X2= 6.63, P = 0.036; X2 = 9.787, P = 0.008, respectively) The risk allele for rs3729547 is T and the risk allele for rs3729843 is A. rs3729547 is a synonymous (isoleucine) variant whereas rs3729843 is a noncoding SNP. In this study, the authors investigated the association between 10 tagging SNPs (these two included) and DCM using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). However, the patients from this study were all members of the Han Chinese population, and therefore, these SNPs must be studied in the context of another ethnic group to validate strong associations between these SNPs and DCM. Additionally, this study was limited by its sample size, as only 97 DCM patients and 189 healthy unrelated controls partook in this study. In a second study published by Rani et al, the TNNT2 gene was sequenced in 162 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and in 179 healthy controls. HCM phenotype ranged from moderate to severe, but a limited number of corrective operations were performed in these HCM patients. In contrast to the Li et al paper, this study was conducted exclusively in patients from India. Fifteen associated variants were uncovered, including rs3729547 (C to T) and rs3729843 (G to A), which were found to be in high linkage disequilibrium in the HCM patients. They also identified a 5bp deletion polymorphism in this Indian population that was previously shown to be associated with HCM patients of French, Spanish, and Japanese origin.",5099

For details of all 25 SNPs in this group, along with the two methods used to calculate overall risk estimates for breast cancer, refer to the SNPedia breast cancer entry.For this particular SNP, as oriented in dbSNP and to the gene, the less common G allele encodes an arginine at position 72 of the protein (where there's normally a proline), and the SNP is commonly called the Arg72 variant, although P72R and Arg72Pro are also common in the literature. Minor allele homozygotes, i.e. rs1042522(C;C) genotypes, live on average 3 years longer than major allele (G;G) homozygotes, based on a study of 9,200+ Danish individuals. The increased longevity is speculated to be related to the increased apoptosis seen for this gain of function SNP, presumably due to ""increased robustness"" during the period of treatment after the diagnosis of life-threatening diseases such as cancer of certain types.A study of 148 individuals with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) concluded rs1042522(G;G) genotypes were more likely to be resistant to first-line chemotherapy, especially the irinotecan plus cisplatin regimen, than those with (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes (60% vs 27%, p = .014). In multivariate analysis, the (G;G) genotype was strongly predictive for shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio HR = 1.952, p = .01).A study of 57 patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy found that rs1042522(G;G) and rs1042522(C;G) genotypes were significantly correlated with a lower response rate (and worse progression) to the combination chemotherapy when compared to rs1042522(C;C) homozygotes (35.7 vs. 66.7%, p-value 0.019).rs1042522 is not associated with SLE in a study of Caucasians, African-Americans, and Asian children and adults.Implicated in type-2 diabetes based on a study of 1,161 Finnish patients.  rs2279744, rs1042522, rs17878362 and rs1625895 associated with high grade endometrial cancer/ 23andMe blog African Americans with rs1042522(G;G) in the p53 gene were 2.15 times more likely to die of colorectal cancer than those with one or no copies of a G at this SNP.

TPH2,Rs1386494,"rs1386494 is a SNP in the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) gene on chromosome 12.  It is located about 20,000 bp from the 5' end of the gene.   This SNP has been found to be associated with various mental health disorders.  TPH1 and TPH2 are two isoforms of the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of 5-HT (serotonin), a neurotransmitter involved in many neurological processes.  Both isoforms have been studied extensively as genetic markers of mental health.  Many association studies have linked the TPH1 gene to suicidality, alcoholism and depression.   However, the second TPH isoform was not discovered until more recently, when it was observed that TPH1 knockout mice were still able to produce normal levels of 5-HT.    It has been shown to be expressed exclusively in the brain, suggesting that it could play a major role in psychiatric disorders. The association between the SNP rs1386494 and major depression (MD) was first reported in a study of a cohort of 300 Caucasian patients with MD.  rs1386494 was found to be the most significantly associated of all 10 SNPs studied, with a p-value of 0.0012.   Another study of the association between the TPH2 gene and depression was conducted in a Finnish population of 119 patients who showed treatment risistance.  The researchers showed that A/A depression patients had significantly more severe depression, as measured by the Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), (p < 0.001) but showed a greater decline in MADRS score as a result of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment (p = 0.03).    Several other studies have confirmed the association of this SNP and linked SNPS with major depression. Similarly, rs1386494 has been linked to suicide attempts.  In a case study of 263 individuals who committed suicide and matched control patients, SNP, haplotype and LD studies support association between the TPH2 SNP and completed suicide.   However, a study of 150 alcohol-dependent patients reported no significant association with alcohol-related suicide behavior.   Both studies were conducted in Caucasian populations.More recently, studies have linked rs1386494 with schizophrenia in Asian populations.  In a case-control study of 289 Malaysians, the G allele was found to be enriched in schizophrenic patients.  Due to the low occurrence of suicidality in the study population, the authors rule out the role of suicidal behavior in this association, supporting a more direct neurological role of this SNP.

TREM2,Rs75932628,"rs75932628(T), a SNP in the TREM2 gene on chromosome 6 resulting in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significantly higher risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease based on two articles published together in 2013 in the New Engl. J. of Med.In one study, the odds ratio for rs75932628(T) was 2.9 (CI: 2.09 to 4.09, P=3.42&#215;10&#8722;10). The mutation had a frequency of 0.46% in controls 85 years of age or older. The authors also observed the association in additional sample sets (odds ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 2.16 to 3.91; P=2.1&#215;10&#8722;12 in combined discovery and replication samples), and found that carriers of rs75932628-T between the ages of 80 and 100 years without Alzheimer's disease had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers (P=0.003).In the other study, analysis of the rs75932628(T) in a series that included 1887 patients with Alzheimer's disease showed a strong, highly significant association (odds ratio, 5.05, CI: 2.77 to 9.16; P=9.0&#215;10&#8722;9). Four other TREM2 gene variants (D87N, T66M, Y38C, and Q33X) were also associated with higher risk for a frontotemporal dementia&#8211;like syndrome when homozygous.Notably, a 2018 study has raised the possibility that in TREM2 R47H mutation carriers, an APOE4 allele may be required for Alzheimer's to develop.Other studies confirming (or in some cases, refuting) an association between R47H and Alzheimer's include: Data shows that rs75932628 is highly significantly associated with the risk of AD across 24,086 AD cases and 148,993 controls of European descent (OR 2.71, p = 4.67 × 10e-25). Based on a study of ~1,000 Alzheimer patients, the R47H mutation does appear to be a risk factor for AD (OR = 2.19, CI:1.04-4.51, p = .03). Individuals with p.R47H associated AD (n = 12) had significantly earlier symptom onset than individuals with no TREM2 variants (n = 551) (55.2 years vs. 61.7 years (p = .02). Based on a Caucasian population comprising ~1,600 late-onset Alzheimer cases, carriers of the R47H variant are at increased risk (OR 7.40, p = 3.66e-06). A study of 474 AD patients from the northwest region of the UK showed a significant association of the R47H mutation with AD (OR 11.08, CI: 2.55-48.09, and Yates' corrected p value = 0.000146). Meta-analysis of 2 family-based and 5 case-control cohorts yielded an overall summary estimate (using case-control data only) for an odds ratio of 1.67 (CI: 0.95-2.92) for the association between the TREM2 R47H and increased AD risk; so while this study replicates the association, it finds a weaker effect than have other studies. A study of ~3,000 AD patients from Spain did see the R47H association with AD (OR 4.12, CI: 1.21-14.00, p = 0.014). A meta-analysis comprising 32,598 subjects from 4 previous studies demonstrated the large effect of the p.R47H variant in AD risk (OR 4.11, CI: 2.99-5.68, p = 5.27×10e-18).

TSHR,Rs2235544,"(Published 2008) Researchers noted that reduced fT3/fT4 ratios may be significant, since various bodily tissues and organs differ in their level of dependence on fT3 and fT4. They analyzed 18 SNPs of DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3 and measured thyroid hormone levels in 552 people on L-T4 hormone replacement therapy, and three healthy control groups not on L-T4 therapy (totalling 2513 people). Analysis was adjusted for age and sex.   Among patients, the _minor_ allele of rs11206244 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio from 0.193 in Common homozygous to 0.175 in Minor homozygous (-0.18) p for trend = 0.004).   Among patients, the _major_ allele of rs2235544 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio (from 0.196 in Minor homozygous to 0.177 in Common homozygous (-.019), p for trend = 0.01).   The two SNPs rs2235544 and rs11206244, were in linkage disequilibrium (LD)  (r2 = 0.41), and rs2235544 was driving the association.   Polymorphisms of rs2235544 in both cases and controls achieved genome-wide significance for effect on fT3/fT4 ratio(p=3.6x10-13) in the general population, each minor allele increasing the ratio by 0.2SD.  Polymorphism did not affect TSH levels.   None of the SNPs in the other deiodinase genes DIO2 DIO3 influenced T3, T4 or TSH serum levels.   Reverse T3 (rT3) levels were not studied.  Regardless of the polymorphism of rs2235544, the fT3:fT4 ratio and fT3 levels were consistently and significantly lower in hypothyroid patients on L-T4 therapy than in healthy controls, and patients' mean TSH was also lower than in controls.  A 2014 study ""Effect of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, DIO1 and DIO2 polymorphisms on L-thyroxine doses required for TSH suppression in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer"" confirmed an earlier study's finding of LD (linkage disequilibrium) between rs11206244 T and rs2235544 A in DIO1.  A 2013 study ""A Meta-Analysis of Thyroid-Related Traits Reveals Novel Loci and Gender-Specific Differences in the Regulation of Thyroid Function"" explained that ""even mild alterations in thyroid function are associated with weight changes, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disorders."" (Abstract). The study focused on genome-wide association data in 26,420 euthyroid (healthy, not hypothyroid or hyperthyroid) individuals phenotyped for serum TSH and 17,520 for FT4 levels. The meta-analysis highlighted a list of 26 SNPs from a wide variety of genes.

TTC26,Rs13225917,"rs13225917 represents a relatively rare SNP tested by the 23andMe v3 chip. Due to its rarity, its effects have not and likely won't be determined through GWAS surveys. In HapMap populations, it's most common among Mexicans and Japanese occurring on the dominant European haplotype, and no homozygous A-allele carriers exist in HapMap, OpenSNP or 1000 Genomes, though this might be due to the overall rarity of the rs13225917(A) allele. The mutation causes an aspartate (D) to asparagine (N) change at position 310 (D310N, p.Asp310Asn) in the Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 26 (TTC26), which might (or might not) result in a damaging missense variant. The protein is IFT complex B protein, also known as DYF13 in nematodes, and it has a proposed function-dependent name of IFT56.TTC26 is thought to play a critical role in ciliogenesis and normal cilia (cellular ""hairs"") function, as determined by protein similarity, and it is highly conserved between ciliated species studied. In studies on Zebrafish, disabling the gene prevented normal development of photoreceptor sensory and other cilia. The protein is necessary for assembly of full length cilia, although the effect (if any) of rs13225917 on its functioning has not been determined. One publication  speculates that this protein may play a role in Inherited Retinal Degeneration and so screening for TTC26 mutations in human ciliopathy|ciliopathies could be warranted, but to date there is no evidence supporting rs13225917 as a mutation of any consequence.

VKORC1,Rs1057910,"SNP rs1057910(A), located in the cytochrome p450 CYP2C9 gene, most commonly encodes the amino acid isoleucine at position 359, and the resulting allele is also known as CYP2C9 1. rs1057910(C) encodes a leucine at this same position, and the resulting allele is called CYP2C9 3. This SNP is also known as Ile359Leu or A1075C.The effect of CYP2C9 variants on drug metabolism should not be predicted without also considering CYP2C9 2, defined as the common loss of function variant rs1799853(T) (NM_000771:c.430C>T, NP_000762:p.144R>C)   /. Studies of the effects of these alleles include:  rs1057910(C;C) genotypes may clear drugs like celecoxib (trade name Celebrex) twice as slowly as rs1057910(A;A) genotypes; the rs1057910(A;C) genotypes are in-between clearance rates. Lower clearance rates will lead to higher internal concentrations of the drug. It is not clear whether this could lead to increased efficacy and/or increased side effects.   rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of tolbutamide, a sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drug used in the treatment of diabetes.   rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of phenytoin, a drug used to treat epilepsy, and therefore tend to need lower doses.  Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) recommend testing for the HLA-B 15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN).  rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of glipizide, a second generation sulfonylurea drug structurally similar to tolbutamide and also used as an oral hypoglycemic agent.   rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of warfarin, and therefore unusually sensitive.

VKORC1,Rs1799853,"rs1799853 is a SNP in the CYP2C9 gene and is linked to poor warfarin metabolism and risk of GI bleeding with some NSAID drugs. The common nomenclature for this polymorphism is CYP2C9 2 (Cys amino acid, T allele; the SNP is also known as C430T or Cys144Arg). Advanced knowledge of this may influence initial warfarin dosing by physicians. Warfarin is monitored through INR (international normalized ratio) and proper dosing is influenced by a variety of factors including warfarin metabolism and diet.  The rs1799853(T) allele encodes a variant amino acid, cysteine, which has been linked to poor metabolism of warfarin and thus sensitivity. The CYP2C9 2 allele is also associated with higher sensitivity to the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin. Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) mention concurrent testing for the HLA-B 15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN). The effect of CYP2C9 variants on drug metabolism should not be predicted without also considering CYP2C9 3, defined as the common loss of function variant rs1057910(C)  (NM_000771:c.430C>T, NP_000762:p.144R>C) /. In a 2009 article titled ""Genetically based impairment in CYP2C8- and CYP2C9-dependent NSAID metabolism as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding: is a combination of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics required to improve personalized medicine?"" Authors reviewed prior research that argued: Individuals carrying minor alleles of this both CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 AND CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) have increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib.  In addition, carriers of the risk allele for CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 have decreased metabolism of Ibuprofen, Flurbiprofen, Piroxicam, and Tenoxicam.   The presence of CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 allele alone does not confer risk with Diclofenac, but when it is combined with CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080), Diclofenac induces hepatoxicity and confers risk of GI bleeding.    In a 2008 article (reviewed in ) titled ""Interaction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes modifies the risk for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related acute gastrointestinal bleeding,"" the study discovered that carriers of CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a GI bleeding event risk OR=1.81 (95% CI=0.95–3.46; P=0.071) and risk increased if carriers drank more than 20g alcohol/day to an OR=1.99 (95% CI=1.06–3.74; P=0.034). As CYP2C8 3 and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium, patients are likely to carry the risk allele to both 8 3 and 9 2, and when they do, The OR (95% CI) for carriers of such a genotype is increased to 1.94 (1.13–3.33), P=0.017.   A 2013 NIH review titled ""PharmGKB summary: very important pharmacogene information for cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8"" reiterated that ""some data suggest that the combined presence of minor risk alleles CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080) and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 is a determinant of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding.""
