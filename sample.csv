NOS1AP,Rs10494366,"rs10494366, a SNP in the NOS1AP gene encoding the nitric oxide synthase I adaptor protein, accounts for some of the variation seen in abnormal heart rhythms, in particular, the QT interval. Based on studies totaling ~4,000 individuals of Caucasian ancestry, homozygotes for one allele have shorter QT intervals, while homozygotes for the other allele have a longer QT interval. A follow-up study determined that one rs10494366(G) allele was associated with a 3.8-ms (CI: 3.0 - 4.6ms, p=7.8x10(-20)) increase in QT interval duration, and two (G) alleles had twice that increase. No increase in risk for sudden death due to a cardiac problem was associated with this SNP, though.  rs10494366 minor homozygotes had a 9.3 msec longer QT interval compared to major homozygotes (p=5.7x10(-5)); rs10918594 minor homozygotes had a 12.5 msec longer QT interval compared to major homozygotes (p=1.5x10(-6)).

The orientation of this SNP was flipped from being on the FWD strand in the human genome assembly GRCh37 to being on the REV strand in assembly GRCh38; then in August 2015 an alert SNPedia user alerted us to the fact that it has somehow flipped back to being on the FWD strand in dbSNP again, whereas in 2017 and now (2018) it is back on the REV strand. This SNP is clearly prone to confusion.23andMe has a second SNP (in addition to rs1800546) assaying this position, which is identified as i5012663.rs1800546 is located on chromosome 9q31.1 within the aldolase B fructose bisphosphate ALDOB gene.  rs1800546 is linked to approximately 65% of hereditary fructosuria (also known as fructose intolerance or HFI) cases in those of European ancestry.  The incidence of HFI in those of European ancestry is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 births.  HFI is an autosomal recessive condition.  This SNP is an ambiguous flip prone to some confusion (see warning at top of page), but to be clear, in SNPedia the current orientation for the ancestral allele of this SNP is now G, while the risk-associated allele is C. Note: Reports from DNA testing labs may be not be clear which strand is being reported. Aldolase B is a critical enzyme involved in the breakdown of the sugar fructose through the glycolysis pathway.  The nucleotide change results in an amino acid substitution at position 149 from alanine to proline (A149P).==CLINICAL OVERVIEW:==Aldolase B fructose bisphosphate catalyzes the reversible reaction of fructose-1-phosphate to glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate.  Further conversion of these 3-carbon products allows the byproducts of fructose metabolism to enter into the glycolysis pathway.  Homozygous loss of function of aldolase B leads to an inability of the body to break down fructose into byproducts for human consumption.  Due to the continuation of the first step in fructose breakdown, the conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, a phosphate sink is created in these patients, in which all the available phosphate is consumed in the cell.  This leads to the halt of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.  Symptoms usually begin at the time of weaning and include: bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, mental depression, jaundice, and cirrhosis that can lead to liver failure and death.   Many patients display a food aversion to fructose-rich foods and practice strict avoidance of fructose-containing foods before their diagnosis.  The current gold standard for testing of fructose intolerance is the hydrogen breath test, in which the patient is administered fructose in the clinical setting, and hydrogen levels are measured before and at intervals after administration of the bolus of fructose.  An increase in hydrogen produced reflects the failure of the patient to absorb fructose, which is then metabolized by bacteria in the gastrointestinal system to give off hydrogen.  The disadvantage of this test is that many patients respond to the fructose administration with signs of severe hypoglycemia including altered consciousness, diaphoresis, and seizures, sometimes resulting in death.  Therefore, elucidation of the causes of HFI and available genetic testing can avert the extreme clinical risks associated with standard of care diagnosis. There is currently no cure for HFI, with the only treatment strict diet modifications to avoid fructose-containing foods.==RISK-ASSOCIATED SNP:==Numerous studies identify and characterize the deleterious nature of the A149P missense mutation, corresponding to rs1800546. In 1988, Cross, et. al first described the genetic based for HFI in four patients as a G→C transversion in the coding sequence of exon 5 at position 149, resulting in an amino acid substitution of alanine to proline in a critical substrate binding region.  PCR amplification revealed the A149P substitution in the proband and 4 members of the pedigree, showing the carrier status of the parents and one sibling, and the affected proband and another sibling,  A case study of seven unrelated Italian patients with HFI was conducted in 2004 looking at the mutational spectrum within the aldolase B gene.  The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was used to perform sequencing of patient DNA for known and novel mutations in the aldolase B gene.  The nine exons, splice junctions, and promoter region were sequenced in each patient. In contrast to American mutations, in which the two most common mutations A149P and A175D account for 85-90% of phenotypes, they account for only 65% of patients in Italians, with many more rare mutations accounting for the remainder of the genetic basis underlying HFI.  In 2005, the structures of the wild type and mutant aldolase B were published by Malay, et. al., revealing a thermolabile mutant.  The A149P mutant is reported to lose catalytic function at temperatures > 15°C, to lose tertiary structure at 33°C, and to lose its secondary structure at 45°C.  The structural constraints placed by the mutant amino acid proline disrupt the secondary structure of the β-sheet, with further reaching implications for the nearby catalytic site, including the neighboring arginine at position 148 and its interactions with Glu189 and Arg303.  The mutant structure was found to have only low levels of catalytic activity in vivo, with a T1/2 of 25°C, corresponding to almost no activity at body temperature of 37°C.  In 2008, Davit-Spraul, et. al screened the molecular basis of HFI in 160 patients from 92 families by PCR-restriction.  Patients for which mutations could not be found were further investigated using exon scanning and LR-PCR to search for novel mutations and deletions or insertions.  In 75% of patients, the three most common mutations, including A149P, were identified.  15% of patients were found to have one A149P mutation with a rare or novel compound heterozygous mutation elsewhere in the aldolase B sequence.

CFTR,I4000320,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in populations with European ancestry:  the average carrier frequency is 1:25. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). The CFTR gene encodes a chloride transporter, gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. It regulates the transport of chloride and other ions across the cell membrane. Mutations in CFTR result in raised sweat chloride, respiratory infections, and pancreatic insufficiency.To date, 1939 mutations in the CFTR gene that cause cystic fibrosis have been curated in the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database. Different combinations of mutations in the gene have different effects on its function and thus cause different disease phenotypes. The most common mutation is deltaF508, which is present in about 70% of the cystic fibrosis patients. '''i4000320''', also known as 2789+5G>A and as rs80224560 to the rest of the world (outside of 23andMe), is a rare mutation in the CFTR gene located at position 117242922 of chromosome 7 that causes a mild form of cystic fibrosis . The risk allele is '''i4000320''' (A). Because cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive inherited disease, one needs to carry two defective copies of the CFTR gene to develop the disease. Most commonly, patients harboring the 2789+5G>A variant will be compound heterozygotes carrying other CFTR mutations.Highsmith ''et al'' first identified the '''i4000320''' SNP in 1997  in a study of eight CF patients in a single inbred family. Three of them were homozygous for the '''i4000320''' mutation, and the rest were compound heterozygotes, harboring both the '''i4000320''' and deltaF508 mutations. Sequencing of exon 14b identified a G to A substitution at position +5 of the splice donor site. Such a mutation was predicted to lead to splicing of exon 14a to exon 15, with the deletion of a 38bp exon 14b from the mature CFTR mRNA, resulting in a frameshift mutation and likely in a truncated protein. Southern hybridization and quantitative analyses were performed to determine how abolishing this mutation is for the splicing activity, demonstrating that the patients homozygous for the 14b mutation could produce 4% of the normal CFTR mRNA compared to normal subjects. The patients homozygous for this mutation suffered from a more mild form of cystic fibrosis compared to patients that were compound heterozygous for deltaF508 and 2789+5G>A mutations. In 2008, the truncated version of the CFTR was experimentally identified, further supporting the predicted outcome of the mutation .The first thorough genotype-to-phenotype correlation analysis for '''i4000320''', after the Highsmith ''et al'' study, was published in 2005, in which 34 French patients having the 2789+5G->A/deltaF508 genotype were compared with their matched homozygous deltaF508 patients. The authors reported that the compound heterozygotes had milder disease phenotype: higher frequency of pancreatic sufficiency, better anthropometric and lung function measure, and lower infection susceptibility . In 2006, Mainz, ''et al'', described the case of the oldest living German brothers who are both compound heterozygotes for 2789+5G->A and deltaF508. This study serves as evidence for the association between this particular splicing mutation with the more mild form of cystic fibrosis and thus long term survival .In another study the authors used the database of the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Registry to examine the genotype-phenotype association by looking at the mortality rate of patients homozygous for deltaF508 and the most common compound heterozygous ones. 17853 out of 28455 patients enrolled in the registry were genotyped. Of these, 82 had the 2789+5G->A mutation. They had a significantly lower standardized mortality rate of 4.4 deaths per 1000 person-years (p-value < 0.0001) than those homozygous for deltaF508 (21.8, which was associated with the highest mortality rate .The distribution and frequencies of the CF mutations have been found to be heterogeneous among different ethnic groups. Knowing the precise distribution of the CF mutations, as well as their frequencies, is crucial for genetic counseling and genetic diagnostics. The available data up to date for the 2789+5G->A polymorphism worldwide is summarized in the following table:{| class=""wikitable""|-! Population !! Year the study was published !!

NPPA,Rs5065,"rs5065, also known as T2238C, is a SNP in the atrial natriuretic precursor A NPPA gene.A large study has been conducted in which 42,418 hypertensive participants 55 or older were followed for several years while on one of four medications: a diuretic, a calcium antagonist, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or an alpha-blocker. The primary endpoint was either fatal heart disease or a heart attack.The blood pressure after six months of rs5065(G;G) patients (note: genotype is in dbSNP orientation, not as published) was lower if the patients were treated with diuretics compared to other medications, with smaller variation seen for (A;A) genotypes. The authors noted that none of the findings retained statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons, but since the trend held in five of seven outcomes, they felt the results were nonetheless worth reporting. In summary, rs5065(G) allele carriers were better off (i.e. experienced more favorable cardiovascular disease outcomes) if treated with the diuretic (in this case, chlorthalidone), whereas rs5065(A;A) carriers were better off if treated with the calcium channel blocker (in this case, amlodipine)."

RNASEL,Rs3738579,"rs3738579 represents a SNP in the 5' UTR region upstream of the RNASEL gene. A study of patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the uterine cervix, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), and breast cancer found 1.5x-2x increased risk for all three cancer types for the rs3738579(T;T) genotype, while finding decreased risk (0.5x) for rs3738579(C;T) heterozygotes. rs3738579(C;C) homozygotes had 0.6x less risk for cervical cancer but increased risk for HNSCC (1.4x) and breast cancer (1.8x). Although statistics were not reported per genotype, a combination of data from all three cancer forms over all genotypes provided strong statistical evidence for rs3738579 as a cancer marker, with a p-value of 4.43x10(-5).Note that the research cited above was published over a decade ago, and there has been no follow-up or replication to our knowledge. It would be best to consider the research preliminary and perhaps of little to no clinical significance (until it is confirmed or replicated in a larger sample)."
RNASEL,Rs486907,"rs486907 is a SNP in the RNase L RNASEL gene that has been associated with cancer risk. The basic rationale behind most of these studies is that RNase L is responsible for deactivating RNA-based viruses that are associated with certain cancers, and therefore SNPs that lead to lower RNase L activity may lead to increased cancer risk. This SNP is also known as R462Q or Arg462Gln.In a study of prostate cancer patients, rs486907(A;G) heterozygotes were calculated to be at 1.5x increased risk, and rs486907(A;A) homozygotes 2x risk (p=0.007).This SNP was also associated with hereditary-prostate-cancer (HPC) predisposition with an odds ratio of 1.97 (p=0.07) in a study of 116 affected Finnish families.See also:"

Identification of the Arg1086His mutation in the alpha subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel (CACNA1S) in a North American family with malignant hyperthermia."
CACNA1S,Rs2281845,"'''rs2281845''' is a SNP located on chromosome 1q32.1, about 250 bp upstream of the first exon of the CACNA1S (voltage-dependent calcium channel, L type)gene. The linkage disequilibrium block containing rs2281845 extends 22 kb downstream and includes the TMEM9 gene (transmembrane protein 9). This SNP has been clinically  associated with tooth development. The minor allele (T) has specifically been associated with reduced mature dentition between the ages of 6 and 14 in women. In a 2011 report, a genome-wide quantitative trait association study conducted with 521,741 SNPs over 5,097 women from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) found a significant (p-value=1.31E-10) association between the rs2281845 T allele and a reduction in permanent teeth erupted (-0.105) between ages 6 and 14. To confirm this finding, an additional 3,696 individuals were also tested for this association. These subjects were drawn from three additional Danish cohorts, as well as one from the United States. The association was replicated in each of the Danish cohorts (p-values=5.43E-05, 1.09E-04, and 0.012, respectively), but the group from the United States exhibited a weak association (p-value=0.242) in the opposite direction (+0.065 teeth). This contradictory finding was attributed to small sample size and deficiencies in phenotype reporting. The original GWAS and replication datasets, when combined for a total of 8,793 subjects, showed a statistically significant (p-value=8.03E-17) negative association with number of permanent teeth (-0.103). Within the same study, three additional SNPs were identified in the initial DNBC cohort GWAS as having a significant association with number of permanent teeth between ages 6 and 14. These SNPs &#8211; rs12424086, rs4491709, rs7924176 &#8211; were each validated to statistical significance with a replication set (p-values=2.30E-12, 2.16E-14, and 5.64E-19, respectively). No loci aside from those containing these four SNPs exhibited a p-value of less than 5.0E-6. Each of these SNPs that were identified in the context of dental development may be confounded by associations with generalized maturation programs. The authors note that while the phenotype of mature teeth was measured here, the SNPs could in fact correlate better with measures of puberty such as &#8220;skeletal maturation, Tanner score and growth spurt,&#8221; with number of mature teeth simply as a manifestation of these other phenotypes. Mechanistically, rs2281845&#8217;s effect on tooth development may be linked to expression of TMEM9. In a study linking SNPs to gene expression in monocytes, several variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs2281845 were found to be significantly associated with TMEM9 expression. The SNP with highest linkage to rs2281845, rs6667912 (r2=0.42) showed a significant association (p-value=6x10E-29). Little is known regarding the function of TMEM9. It is a well-conserved, 26kDa transmembrane protein with expression throughout a wide variety of human tissues and cells. An &#8216;&#8216;in vitro&#8217;&#8217; study showed localization to the ER, late endosomes, and lysosomes along with  LAMP1 coexpression, but its function within the cell is not yet well-characterized."

RET,Rs2506030,"rs2506030 is a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in gene RET. Its ancestral/non-risk allele is A and derived allele G. RET (ret proto-oncogene) is a cadherin family member and encodes a receptor tyrosine kinases. Functionally, it is involved in neural crest development. It’s located on the plus strand at 10q11.2 of the human genome spanning over 50K bp. There are 21 exons in the gene and 2 isoforms. Other than Hirschsprung disease, mutations in this gene is also associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia And Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) or congenital aganglionosis is a developmental defect characterized by the absence of neuronal ganglia in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Patients can be classified into 3 sub categories based on the length of the colon: short segment, long segment, or total colonic aganglionosis (TCA). The incidence is roughly 15/100,000 in population of European descent and twice as high for Asians. HSCR is a non-Mendelian disease. Mutations in a few genes have been identified to be associated with HSCR: RET, GDNF, NRTN, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, ZEB2, PHOX2B, KIAA1279, TCF4, and L1CAM.rs2506030 was first identified by Charkravarti’s group in a family-based GWAS study published in 2015. A total of 220 European American trios with short-segment HSCR were recruited and their DNA genotyped using Affymetrix platform, resulting in 500,000 SNPs. Association was tested using case pseudo-control and rs2506030 is statistically significantly different in the two groups (p value 2.78*10^-15). Furthermore, the statistical significance was confirmed in a replication study of 429 more HSCR trios of all segment lengths (p value 2.02*10^-4, combined p value 4.44*10-15, odds ratio = 2.0). Note that rs2506030 is independent of another common RET SNP rs2435357, which is common in HSCR patients based on previous studies. They hypothesize that rs2506030 affects a RET enhancer. Another study by the same group further studied rs2506030 in HSCR patients. This study includes a population case control comparison as well as family based association testing. Comparing the allele frequencies in cases and controls, there was a significant difference between allele frequencies in rs2506030  (p value 4.7*10^-10). Similarly, there is significant statistical evidence (p value = 5.3*10^9) of higher frequency of risk allele homozygotes in cases. OR was estimated to be 1.8. In addition, TDT was performed in 254 trios and 72 duos and the risk allele is over transmitted to probands (p = 9.5*10^-6)."

ADCY2,Rs13166360,"rs13166360 at 5p15.31 is located in an exon of adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2) and encodes a missense mutation (valine&#8594;leucine) in a transmembrane domain of the protein. A GWAS has associated '''rs13166360''' with bipolar disorder in people of European ancestry. == '''Clinical Background''' ==Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a severe mood disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and mania. BD has a lifetime prevalence of 1% in the general population (4% in the United States), and therefore can be classified as a common condition. To date, there does not exist any clear associations between race or socioeconomic status, and the onset of BD. Bipolar Disorders are amongst the 10 highest burden diseases, as ranked by the World Health Organization. In particular, those suffering from bipolar disorder are at a higher risk of suicide, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse . For further information about bipolar disorder, wikipedia offers a great article: .== '''SNP Data''' ==A GWAS by Muhleisen and coworkers links '''rs13166360''' to Bipolar Disorder. The authors were motivated by the success of a previous GWAS for bipolar disorder  that had not implicated the ADCY2 gene, and added additional subjects (2,266) and controls (5,028) in order to increase the power of this study. This data primarily comes from the MooDS (Systematic Investigation of the Molecular Causes of Major Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia) consortium. The new data unique to the Muhleisen et al study, which helped to find '''rs13166360''', was primarily genotyped on the Illumina Infinium assay. In all, the combined datasets analyzed ~2.3 million SNPs from 9,747 cases and 14,278 controls that are of European Ancestry, but who currently live in Europe, Australia and the USA. This represents the largest BD GWAS to date. The datasets were merged according to a standardized genomic control &#955;-factor (1.018) in order to control for p-value inflation. The meta-analysis found 56 SNPs that passed genome-wide significance at 5 distinct genetic loci. Of these 5 loci, 3 had been previously described (ANK3, ODZ4, and TRANK1), while two were completely novel (ADCY2 and the region between MIR2113 and POU3F2)'''Rs13166360''' was found as a proxy to another novel SNP (rs17836816) in the ADCY2 gene (r2=0.95), and presented genome-wide significance (p-value 1.81x10-8 with an allelic odds ratio of 1.14). Neither had previously been described in the context of Bipolar Disorder, and ADCY2 SNPs had not previously been associated with BD. '''Rs13166360''' describes a deviation from the major allele G to T (minor allele) that encodes a Valine to Leucine missense codon in ADCY2.== '''Relation to Disease''' ==There is consensus amongst the scientific and medical community that Bipolar Disorder is a multifactorial disease, with both genetic and environmental causes. ADCY2 is an integral membrane protein that, upon activation by heterotrimertic G proteins, catalyzes formation of the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that then activates protein kinase A (PKA) pathways. Many neurotransmitters function through G protein-coupled receptors, that in turn signal through these heterotrimeric G proteins. GPCRs represent a large pool of candidate genes for neuropsychiatric disorders, and accordingly, many antipsychotics target multiple receptors at once. Since ADCY2 is a signal integrator that acts downstream of many of these signaling pathways, any altercation to its function would occur downstream of multiple receptors and neurotransmitter pathways. It is not currently known if the V147L mutation is deleterious to the protein. While multiple adenylate cyclase genes exist, ADCY2 is uniquely expressed in the brain."

The variant has been strongly associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia. is evidence to suggest that ApoE-ε3ch may be associated with strong resistance to developing Alzheimer's disease. A 2019 study  reported that that a carrier of a pathogenic PSEN1 mutation, known to cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease, who was also a homozygous ApoE3ch carrier, did not show cognitive symptoms before her seventies, almost three decades after expected onset. Autosomal dominant forms of Alzheimer's disease and sporadic Alzheimer's disease show largely similar pathogenesis. Likewise, common APOE alleles(ApoE-ε2, ApoE-ε3, and ApoE-ε4) have similar effects in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (, ApoE-ε4 carriers have earlier onset, ApoE-ε2 alleles have later onset). Together, this these findings suggest that being a homozygous ApoE-ε3ch carrier will potentially also convey protection against sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, assuming that ApoE-ε3ch follows an allele-dose risk pattern similar to what has been observed for common APOE alleles , heterozygous ApoE-ε3ch carriage may also be convey protection against sporadic Alzheimer's disease."

However, in older publications, this position is historically described as being amino acid '''146''' (not 164), and so p.Lys146Gln and p.Lys146Glu can also be found as aliases in the literature.The K164E/K146E variant has been designated ApoE1-Harrisburg according to  OMIM, and is a dominant mutation leading to familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.

Only 2 of 25 heterozygotes had AD versus 23 controls (4128 LOAD, and 4986 controls). The minor allele of rs199768005 is in phase with the APOE epsilon 3 allele. p.V236E divides the epsilon 3 haplotype into epsilon 3b (the minor allele of rs199768005) and epsilon 3a (major allele of rs199768005). The risk of AD among those with epsilon 3b genotype was substantially reduced(OR=0.11,0.02-0.36, P=2.32x10-3). This decrease in AD risk was AD independent of the epsilon 2, 3 and 4 alleles.

Subsequent studies have implicated the Arg160Cys change in this haplotype as being responsible for the defective lipoprotein binding associated with that condition.See also: OMIM  107741.0008In 23andMe data, rs387906567 is referred to as i5000217 and i6007504."

APOE,Rs429358,"This SNP, located in the fourth exon of the ApoE gene, affects the amino acid at position 130 of the resulting protein. The more common rs429358 allele is (T). If the allele is (C) and the same chromosome also harbors the rs7412(C) allele, the combination is known as an APOE-ε4 allele. The APOE-ε4 allele has a strong influence on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Many studies have estimated the level of risk, and it varies depending on age, sex, ethnicity, and other factors. One meta-analysis estimated the odds ratios for homozygous rs429358(C;C) individuals compared to the more common ApoE3/ApoE3 homozygotes to be 12x for late-onset Alzheimer's and 61x for early-onset disease. Meta-analyses have also supported the association between the APOE-ε4 allele and somewhat increased risk for heart disease, with an odds ratio of 1.42 (CI: 1.26 - 1.61).Note: Although ApoE status is technically defined by these two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412, a SNP in the adjacent ApoC1 gene, rs4420638, is co-inherited with ApoE and thus often - though not completely - predictive of it."

APOE,Rs4420638,"Apolipoprotein E ApoE status is technically defined by two different SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412.  This SNP, rs4420638, is situated about 14kb away in the adjacent ApoC1 gene and is co-inherited with ApoE and thus associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.rs4420638 (the proxy SNP) is not independent of rs429358. These two SNPs are correlated with each other and it's believed that most of the association with AD at rs4420638 is due to its proximity to rs429358. That said, rs4420638 is not a perfect proxy for rs429358 either -- rs4420638 correlates better for certain genotypes and for certain ethnicities. For example, if you have the genotype at rs4420638 that is more correlated with the e4 allele of APOE, you still only have a 50% chance of actually having the e4 allele. And rs4420638 is not very predictive for any genotype in African populations. The (G;G) form of this SNP indicates increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, however the probability and amount of increased risk is subject to some disagreement. The initial report concerning this SNP indicated a high likelihood that rs4420638(G;G) homozygotes were predictably ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes and thus at significantly (15 fold or higher) risk for Alzheimer's. However, one testing service has estimated pers. communication that 25% to 50% of people with the (G;G) are *not* actually ApoE4 homozygotes, and are more likely to be at ~2-3x increased risk based on being ApoE3/ApoE4 heterozygotes. If you were tested on deCODEme or 23andMe v3 platform, ignore this proxy and just check your status at rs429358 and rs7412. 23andme added rs429358 for people who tested on the v3 platform on 04/14/2011, so you should re-download your data if you haven't.This  AlzForum.org article suggests that ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes have a ~15-fold increased risk for developing the disease compared to ApoE3/ApoE3 carriers, whereas rs4420638(A;G) individuals have a ~3-fold increased risk.ApoE4 status is notable as being the variation that several well known scientists, including Nobel Prize winner User:Watson|James Watson, request not to learn when having their own genomes analyzed.Meta-analyses have also supported the association between the ApoE4 allele and somewhat increased risk for heart disease, with an odds ratio of 1.42 (CI: 1.26 - 1.61)./ 23andMe blog each rs4420638(G) lowered CRP by 21.8% also associated with higher total cholesterol, LDL choelsterol and triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterolNote: the :Category:On_chip_Affy500k|Affymetrix 500K chip is said to poorly tag (ie assay) this particular SNP.

F2,Rs1799963,"rs1799963 is a SNP far more commonly known as the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin F2 gene. 23andMe's i3002432 is another name for rs1799963.Due to the interactions of the corresponding protein with the Factor V protein, SNPs in these two coagulation-related genes are often studied together. In particular, rs1799963 is often studied together with rs6025.In a 2013 meta-analysis of 31 databases, the analysis of i3002432 / rs1799963 (PT20210A or prothrombin or Factor 2) was based on 9,134 cases and 17,606 controls. The AG variant average risk for Venous Thromboembolism was 2.8, and risk was higher for younger subjects ((< 45 years old, OR: 3.19; ≥ 45 years old, OR: 2.57) and for women taking oral contraceptives (women not using OCs, OR: 2.73; women using OCs, OR: 5.58). Further analysis by outcome revealed that more the risk for Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was highest at 4.4 (based on 303 cases and 2,723 controls), whereas for Venous thromboembolism OR was 3.0, and for Venous thrombosis (w/o pulmonary embolism) OR 2.6. The AA variant risk was 6.74, but the odds ratio for homozygotes was based on only 28 subjects among cases and 4 controls. A larger risk was seen in rs6025 Factor V Leiden SNP variants. For a more complete discussion, see rs6025., In addition to the literature associating the G20210A variant with thromboembolism in general, several studies have found that this variant significantly (2 - 20 fold) increases the risk for ischemic stroke (aka cerebral ischemia) in individuals with patent foramen ovale (PFO), or hole in the heart.

Gaucher's disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to deficient activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase, and over 200 mutations have been described in the GBA gene, many of which lead to Gaucher Type I or Type II disease.The mutation encoded by rs104886460 is one of the top 5 or so Gaucher-related variations found in Ashkenazi Jews, and is known as ""IVS2+1G-A"". It is most commonly associated with Gaucher Type I disease but has also been seen associated with Type II disease, apparently depending on the nature of the ""other"" GBA mutation found in an individual (since it's a recessive condition requiring both alleles to be affected).See also: OMIM  606463.0015"
GBA,Rs1064651,"rs1064651, also known as Asp448His or D448H, is a SNP in exon 9 of the GBA gene on chromosome 1. As the protein was originally numbered, though, this variation occurred at amino acid 409 (rather than 448), so the scientific literature still often refers to this mutation as Asp409His or D409H.Mutations in both copies of a person's GBA gene may lead to Gaucher's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. When one of the mutations is the D409H mutation, the clinical description may be Gaucher disease type 3C, involving valvular heart disease. However, the clinical presentation appears to be highly variable as well as dependent on which two mutations are present. For more information, see OMIM  606463.0006.Be aware that since this mutation is due to a G>C (tranversion) when oriented in the direction the gene is transcribed, interpretation can be problematic due to  orientation issues involving  ambiguous flips."

GBA,Rs421016,"rs421016, also known as L444P or Leu444Pro, is a SNP causing an amino acid change in the GBA gene; it is among the most common mutations associated with Gaucher disease of any type.  Amino acid predictions from genome sequence may predict this as L483P or Leu483Pro; this disparity in position calling may be due to a 39 peptide signal sequence. Polyphen 2 predicts  P04062 L483P to be ""possibly damaging"" with a score of 0.857 (sensitivity: 0.83; specificity: 0.93). ( P04062 is the uniprot ID for GBA.)The risk allele (in current dbSNP orientation) is (G), and as the inheritance is autosomal recessive, individuals must either be compound heterozygotes (for two different GBA mutations) or rs421016(G;G) homozygotes to develop Gaucher disease. There are over 300 mutations now known to occur in the GBA gene, with many associated with increasing risk for either type I, II, or III Gaucher disease.This SNP (along with others associated with Gaucher disease) is studied extensively in Ashkenazi Jewish populations where it is found in relatively high frequency.Note: this SNP used to have a ""mirror"" SNP, rs35095275, representing the opposite strand yet the same exact nucleotide position; it has now been merged into this SNP.One copy of rs421016(G) has also been shown to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease ~5 fold across multiple ethnicities, and to lower a bit the age of onset of Parkinson's. In one study, the estimated age-specific risk for Parkinson's disease at 60 and 80 years of age was 4.7% and 9.1% among Gaucher disease patients, i.e. those carrying two Gaucher GBA mutations, compared with 1.5% and 7.7% among GBA mutation heterozygotes, and 0.7% and 2.1% for carriers of zero Gaucher GBA mutations, respectively.

CLTCL1,Rs1061325,"Also known as M1316V or p.Met1316Val, rs1061325 represents a common variant in the clathrin heavy chain like 1 CLTCL1 gene on chromosome 22. The (T) allele is associated with the Met (M) codon, and the (C) with Val (V), as represented on the forward/plus strand.A 2019 publication gathered a fair amount of attention in the popular press by speculating that the V1316 allele has a selective advantage in processing carbohydrate-rich diets (presumably including those with lots of sugar) of farmers compared to the M1316 allele found at somewhat higher frequencies in hunter-gatherers (who theoretically consume fewer carbs). The authors suggest that heterozygotes may have a selective advantage, with M1316 homozygotes presumably most prone to developing insulin resistance on modern diets."

This allele is known as the ALDH*2 form, and individuals possessing either one or two copies of it show alcohol-related sensitivity responses including facial flushing, and severe hangovers (and hence they are usually not regular drinkers).

CD40,Rs4810485,"rs4810485 is a SNP associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. At this locus, the minor allele, T, protects against RA. The SNP is located on chromosome 20q13 in the second intron of the CD40 gene, which encodes a receptor that is expressed on the surface of multiple immune cells. CD40 binds the ligand CD154 which is expressed by activated T cells, and this interaction plays a critical role in T cell helper activity in the immune system. rs4810495 is closely linked with another SNP, rs1883832, that appears to lesson translation of the CD40 gene, affecting this critical signaling pathway that leads to B cell proliferation . Mouse model knockouts of CD40 have been shown to alleviate arthritis . The association between rs4810485 and RA was first identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis and two subsequent replication studies in patients with European ancestry . This study looked at the major allele G versus the minor allele T in a meta-analysis of previous GWAS followed by two replication studies. In the GWAS meta-analysis, which had 3,393 cases and 12,460 controls, they found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2.4x10-7 and an odds ratio of 0.83. Two replication studies looking at 31 loci in combined 3,929 cases and 5,807 controls found the position to be associated with the disease with a p-value of 0.0032 and an odds ratio of 0.91. Jointly, the meta-analysis and replication studies showed an association with a p-value of 8.2x10-9 surpassing a conservative level of significance for joint analysis and an odds ratio of 0.87, suggesting that the minor allele T gives a modest protective effect against RA.The association with RA was confirmed in a targeted validation study in the United Kingdom with 3,962 cases and 3,531 control patients . This study found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2x10-4 and an odds ratio of 0.86. Since this was a targeted study looking at 4 specific loci, the p-value is significant. Again, the odds ratio suggests a modest protective affect for the minor allele T.An additional study looked at this SNP and its association with RA in individuals of Korean ancestry . This study found no association between rs4810485 and RA in patients with Korean ancestry. The targeted validation study looked at 5 SNPs associated with RA in Europeans in 1,113 Korean cases and 988 controls, and found a p-value of 0.39 and an odds ratio of 1.06, suggesting no association between the SNP and RA in Koreans. This case highlights the importance of accounting for ancestry when testing genome-wide associations."

MSH3,Rs70991108,"rs70991108 is a polymorphism consisting of a 19-bp deletion in the first intron of the dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene. The wild-type (non-deletion) allele is a bit more common than the deletion allele in most populations. Several studies have linked this SNP to alterations in folic acid (and folate) metabolism. A study of 1,215 subjects  from the Framingham Offspring Study concluded that rs70991108 influences the prevalence of circulating folic acid levels. Specifically, folic acid intake over 500ug/d led to high circulating (unmetabolized) folic acid levels in subjects homozygous for the deletion genotype. When folic acid intake was under 250ug/d, the deletion/deletion homozygotes had lower RBC folate (732.2 nmol/L) compared with the non-deletion genotype (844.4 nmol/L). A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs70991108 deletion allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~4.6x for heterozygous and homozygous rs70991108 deletion genotypes, respectively (p=0.05). If a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele was also a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).Studies have also looked for connections between this SNP and the risk of having a baby born with spina bifida, but the results are inconsistent between studies:* PMID 14735580, PMID 15755837: suggested the del/del genotype increased risk for spina bifida and pre-term delivery* : suggested that the del/del genotype actually reduced risk for spina bifida* : found no connection whatsoever between the del/del genotype and spina bifida risk"

SNCA,Rs2736990,"rs2736990 is a SNP associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degradation of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra.  Rs273990 is located on chromosome 4q22 in the synuclein-alpha SNCA locus. The function of SNCA is not fully understood, but it predominately found in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, and it is thought that it plays a role in maintaining adequate supplies of synaptic vesicles.  SNCA is also a major component of Lewy Bodies (LB), protein accumulations often found in neurons in patients with PD.The best evidence for the association of rs2736990 with PD was provided in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that found an increased frequency of the minor C allele (T is the major allele) in position 90897564 among cases compared to controls.   The study first identified this SNP in a pool of 1,713 cases and 3,978 controls of European ancestry.  The researchers then successfully replicated this significant finding in a separate group of 3,361 cases and 4,573 controls, also of European ancestry.   Estimates of effect size and statistical significance from the pooled dataset (which incorporates both groups) are as follows: OR = 1.23, p = 2.24 x 10-17 .   Several other studies have also examined the relationship between rs2736990 and PD. A group of Japanese researchers conducting a GWAS on 2,011 cases and 18,381 controls of Japanese descent found a significant association of rs2736990 with PD that survived Bonferroni correction (p-value not reported) .  Another group looked at only the rs2736990 SNP in 515 cases and 450 controls of Chinese descent and found the minor C allele was significantly more frequent in patients with PD (OR=1.26, p = 0.017).  Other studies have validated the association between rs2736990 and PD in European populations:  The Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center tested rs2736990 only in 344 cases and 275 controls and found a significant association (OR = 1.40, p = 0.0032); another group combined data from previous GWAS studies with their own data to create a GWAS dataset of 1752 cases and 1745 controls that yielded a significant association (OR = 1.29, p = 6.7 x 10-8) ; finally, a GWAS conducted on 772 cases and 2024 controls of Dutch descent found a significant association between rs2736990 and PD (OR = 1.325, p = 1.63 x 10-5). It is not known with certainty how mutations in synuclein-alpha contribute to PD; however, mutations in this gene, both missense and copy number variants, have been linked to the development of PD. In addition, rs2736990 is one of several SNP&#8217;s in the SNCA locus significantly associated with PD in GWAS studies, and the significant association of this SNP with PD has been replicated and validated in several subsequent studies.  Moreover, estimates of effect size are similar across studies.  As such, the biological plausibility of this mutation appears high.  One candidate mechanism for development of PD due to SNCA hypothesizes that misfolded or excessively produced synuclein-alpha proteins accumulate in the neuron and interfere with normal function until they eventually cause death. This theory is supported by the abundance of synuclein-alpha proteins in LB&#8217;s found in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.  However, it is unclear if these LB&#8217;s are a response to injury or themselves the cause of death. Linkage disequilibrium patterns and tagSNP transferability among European populations.

TNNT2,Rs3729547,"rs3729547, is a SNP that was recently shown to be mildly associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  in the Han Chinese population and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Indian population.  . This SNP is located within  the coding sequence of the TNNT2 gene, which encodes a component of the troponin complex critical for proper sarcomeric contractility in cardiomyocytes, the cell type driving contraction in the heart. A number of earlier studies have shown that mutations in TNNT2 can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.    characterized by a thinning of the ventricular wall, or conversely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by a thickening of the ventricular wall. Both conditions lead to an overall weakening of the heart muscle and can lead to heart failure or sudden cardiac death.  The molecular mechanisms whereby mutations in the same gene (TNNT2) can lead to two diseases (DCM and HCM) with such contrasting phenotypes are still not well-understood. In a study by Li et al, rs3729547 (C to T) and another tagging SNP also in TNNT2, rs3729843 (G to A),  were shown to be associated with DCM in a cohort of Han Chinese individuals (X2= 6.63, P = 0.036; X2 = 9.787, P = 0.008, respectively) The risk allele for rs3729547 is T and the risk allele for rs3729843 is A. rs3729547 is a synonymous (isoleucine) variant whereas rs3729843 is a noncoding SNP. In this study, the authors investigated the association between 10 tagging SNPs (these two included) and DCM using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). However, the patients from this study were all members of the Han Chinese population, and therefore, these SNPs must be studied in the context of another ethnic group to validate strong associations between these SNPs and DCM. Additionally, this study was limited by its sample size, as only 97 DCM patients and 189 healthy unrelated controls partook in this study. In a second study published by Rani et al, the TNNT2 gene was sequenced in 162 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and in 179 healthy controls. HCM phenotype ranged from moderate to severe, but a limited number of corrective operations were performed in these HCM patients. In contrast to the Li et al paper, this study was conducted exclusively in patients from India. Fifteen associated variants were uncovered, including rs3729547 (C to T) and rs3729843 (G to A), which were found to be in high linkage disequilibrium in the HCM patients. They also identified a 5bp deletion polymorphism in this Indian population that was previously shown to be associated with HCM patients of French, Spanish, and Japanese origin."

This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers. These risks include:* An increased risk for breast cancer is reported in premenopausal African-American women, based on a study of 200 women.

ADRA2B,Rs2229169,"This is a good proxy for alpha-2B-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2B) deletion polymorphism (del301–303; rs4066772). The minor rs2229169 allele was in a strict linkage disequilibrium with the deletion of three amino acids in ADRA2B (Ins/Del301-303) in a mixed African–American/white group  and in a large Chinese study .Alpha-2B adrenergic receptors contribute to norepinephrine stimulation in the brain and to peripheral vasoconstriction. The deletion polymorphism del301–303 encodes a version of the receptor that, unlike normal alpha-2B receptors, fails to decrease its activity (desensitize) in response to prolonged stimulation . This may result in both negative cardiovascular consequences and positive cognitive effects.A large population cohort of Finnish middle-aged men (1606 men, mean age at the start 53 years) was followed for the average time of 18 years. Acute coronary events defined as hospitalizations for myocardial infarction or prolonged acute chest pain were more frequent in the men with del301–303 polymorphism: Del/Del OR=1.57 (P=0.002), Del/Ins OR=1.25 (P=0.077), Ins/Ins OR=1. Associations with the number of sudden cardiac deaths and overall cardiac heart disease mortality were also observed, but they would not be significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. A study of Koreans compared more than 600 patients hospitalized for an ischemic stroke with control subjects. The deletion polymorphism conferred higher risk of ischemic stroke: Del/Del OR=1.78 (P=0.007), Del/Ins OR=1.25 (P=0.107), Ins/Ins OR=1. Association of the deletion genotype with small-vessel disease was the main contributor to the risk. In a study of more than 400 young Swiss adults, the carriers of del301–303 polymorphism had about 20% better memory for emotional photographs, both positive and negative. This enhancement of emotional memory was selective: the level of emotions caused by the photographs, the memory for neutral photographs, working memory, and attention were not dependent on genotype. Among the Rwandan genocide refugees, the same authors found the deletion to be associated with increased re-experiencing of traumatic events but independently from PTSD, which was distributed equally among the genotypes. Homozygous rs2229169 Chinese subjects, being by extension del301–303 homozygotes, also had about 20% better (shorter) reaction time in a stop-go cognitive test as compared to wild-type homozygotes."

A variant located 64 bp upstream of the first untranslated exon (exon 1A), consisting of a 5 bp insertion/deletion CGGGG (rs77571059), may be the causative SNP in this region that is most responsible for increasing SLE risk.

CASP9,Rs1052576,"also known as Q221Rrs1052576 is located on chromosome 1p36.21 in the coding region of CASP9. The CAG to CGG transition results in the allele Q221R. This SNP is associated with ADHD, general cancer risk, multiple myeloma, non-small cell lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma      .Generally the A allele confers protection from a variety of cancers. An intact apoptotic pathway is essential for many cellular processes including development, immune response and prevention of cellular transformation. Caspases are cysteinyl aspartate proteases involved in signal transduction cascades that result in programmed cell death. CASP9 is an initiator caspase and part of the intrinsic pathway, which is an evolutionarily conserved apoptotic pathway. It is responsible for cleaving and activating the executioner caspases CASP3, CASP6, CASP7, leading to nuclear membrane breakdown, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis.In their 2014 study, Lee et al performed an ADHD GWAS meta-analysis to identify casual SNPS in ADHD by focusing on SNPs in coding regions as well as a secondary analysis for pathway enrichement . They identified 11 candidate SNPS, three in the CASP9 gene, rs1052576, rs1052571, rs1820204. This GWAS was performed on a dataset that contained 428,074 SNPS from a publicly available database. This data set is derived from the IMAGE project which comprises of 924 trios of European decent, either an affected child and both parents or an affected child and one sibling and one parent. Patients in this study had to meet stringent criteria as well as live with one biological parent and one full sibling to control for environmental factors. The authors identified SNPS using two approaches. The first approach filtered SNPs by linkage disequilibrium analysis followed by a second approach to  that enriched for SNPs using pathway based analysis algorithm called i-GSEA. The authors used a p<0.05 threshold as well as an FDR cutoff of 0.1 to correct for the multiple testing conditions.  For rs1052576 p=0.042. Odds ratio could not be determined from the data provided in the manuscript. In another recent study, Yan et al performed a meta-analysis of the rs1052576 SNP in CASP-9 . Seven case-control studies with a total of 1668 cancer cases and 2294 healthy controls were analyzed. Six types of cancer were studied: gastric cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, myeloma and liver cancer. Four studies were performed in China, two in the USA and one in Russia. The &#8220;A&#8221; allele carriers of rs1052576 had overall reduced risk for cancer: the ""A"" allele conferred an OR=0.72( 0.58-0.89) p=0.003. However, these data were only statistically significant in Asian populations: rs1052576-A resulted in an OR=0.60 with a 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.81 and a p<0.001, in Asians irrespective of the national origin of the study. Caucasian carriers of rs1052576-A did trend towards a lower OR, however, these data did not reach statistical significance and may warrant further studies: OR=0.85(0.70-1.04), p=0.11. In 2009, Andrew et al identified SNPs to predict bladder cancer susceptibility and survival .  They performed a case-controlled study with 832 bladder cancer cases and 1,191 controls using a population of New Hampshire residents;  95% of this cohort was of Caucasian origin. SNPs that modulated bladder cancer survival were selected using an FDR threshold of <0.5. They found that the rs1052576-G allele reduced survival time for carriers with bladder cancer and increased risk of death due to bladder cancer OR=1.4 (0.8-2.4) and p=0.003. Hosgood, et al performed a population based case control study of 128 cases of women with multiple myeloma and 516 controls all from Connecticut . rs1052576-AG conferred a decreased risk of multiple myeloma OR=0.8 (0.5-1.3) p=0.41, rs1052576-AA OR=0.5 (0.3-0.9)p=0.02,  p=0.02 for the trend. These data need to be considered with care, as the rs1052576-AA odds ratio was the only value that reached near statistical significance on its own. Apoptosis is particularly important in the development of B-lymphocytes. A role for CASP9 in these B-cell lymphomas is likely to be of mechanistic importance. In 2006, Lan et al investigated the effect of SNPs in CASP3 Ex8-280C>A (rs6948) and Ex8+567T>C (rs1049216), CASP8 Ex14-271A>T (rs13113), casp9 Ex5+32G>A (rs1052576) and CASP10 Ex3-171A>G (rs3900115) in the risk of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR. rs1052576-AA genotype had an OR=0.7 (0.5-1.0) p=0.044 for all Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas.  In addition, there were protective effects for the rs1052576-A allele in B-cell lymphomas specifically: rs1052576-AA OR=0.7 (0.5-1.0) p=0.040. The protective effect of the rs1052576-A allele was not statistically significant in T cell lymphomas. This may reflect a small sample size or an inherent difference in the biology of the two cell types. Finally, B-cell lymphomas were further divided into three subtypes: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  The rs1052576-AG conferred an OR=0.6 (0.4-1.0) p=0.039 for follicular lymphoma. It is likely that the rs1052576-AA genotype is protected, however the numbers were small of this genotype and did not reach statistical significance. CASP9 is an important member of the apoptotic pathway and has clear mechanistic importance in the regulation of apoptosis. rs1052576 -G confers an increased risk of cancer in numerous studies. There does seem to be a dose dependent effect, however, this remains to be confirmed with more studies.   A allele associated with lower odds of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (OR(AA+AG) = 0.6, 95% CI, 0.4-1.0) among 996 women located in Connecticut (461 cases, 535 controls) A allele associated with lower odds of Multiple myeloma (OR(AG) = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.5-1.3; OR(AA) = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9; p-trend = 0.02) among 664 women located in Connecticut (128 cases, 516 controls)"

TSHR,Rs2235544,"(Published 2008) Researchers noted that reduced fT3/fT4 ratios may be significant, since various bodily tissues and organs differ in their level of dependence on fT3 and fT4. They analyzed 18 SNPs of DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3 and measured thyroid hormone levels in 552 people on L-T4 hormone replacement therapy, and three healthy control groups not on L-T4 therapy (totalling 2513 people). Analysis was adjusted for age and sex. * Among patients, the _minor_ allele of rs11206244 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio from 0.193 in Common homozygous to 0.175 in Minor homozygous (-0.18) p for trend = 0.004). * Among patients, the _major_ allele of rs2235544 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio (from 0.196 in Minor homozygous to 0.177 in Common homozygous (-.019), p for trend = 0.01). * The two SNPs rs2235544 and rs11206244, were in linkage disequilibrium (LD)  (r2 = 0.41), and rs2235544 was driving the association. * Polymorphisms of rs2235544 in both cases and controls achieved genome-wide significance for effect on fT3/fT4 ratio(p=3.6x10-13) in the general population, each minor allele increasing the ratio by 0.2SD.* Polymorphism did not affect TSH levels. * None of the SNPs in the other deiodinase genes DIO2 DIO3 influenced T3, T4 or TSH serum levels. * Reverse T3 (rT3) levels were not studied.* Regardless of the polymorphism of rs2235544, the fT3:fT4 ratio and fT3 levels were consistently and significantly lower in hypothyroid patients on L-T4 therapy than in healthy controls, and patients' mean TSH was also lower than in controls.  A 2014 study ""Effect of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, DIO1 and DIO2 polymorphisms on L-thyroxine doses required for TSH suppression in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer"" confirmed an earlier study's finding of LD (linkage disequilibrium) between rs11206244 T and rs2235544 A in DIO1.  A 2013 study ""A Meta-Analysis of Thyroid-Related Traits Reveals Novel Loci and Gender-Specific Differences in the Regulation of Thyroid Function"" explained that ""even mild alterations in thyroid function are associated with weight changes, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disorders."" (Abstract). The study focused on genome-wide association data in 26,420 euthyroid (healthy, not hypothyroid or hyperthyroid) individuals phenotyped for serum TSH and 17,520 for FT4 levels. The meta-analysis highlighted a list of 26 SNPs from a wide variety of genes. * For DIO1 rs2235544 A/C, the A allele (51% frequency) was associated with an increase in FT4 levels, with a slightly larger effect on males than females. .

The distribution of four haplotypes was also significantly different between the two study groups with the TC (Thr-Gly) haplotype more frequently detected in patients with depression."" (Abstract). Published 2009. This study analyzed ""(ORFa)-Gly3Asp (rs12885300) and Thr92Ala (rs225014) with potential functions on the activity of DIO2."" Findings in abstract: ""Both SNPs were significantly higher in the BPAD (Bipolar disorder) patients, with odds ratios of 1.489 ... and 1.616 ... respectively. Individuals with two copies of the variant 3Gly or 92Ala were at greater risk of BPAD.... Haplotypes ORFa-3Asp-92Ala and ORFa-3Gly-92Ala indicated higher susceptibility for BPAD with odds ratios of 3.759 (95% CI=2.013-7.020) and 1.292 (95% CI=1.017-1.642), respectively, while ORFa-3Asp-92Thr probably played a protective role with an odds ratio of 0.395 (95% CI=0.284-0.549)."" (Abstract)==Thyroid hormone metabolism and treatment for hypothyroidism==. According to a 2009 study of 500 patients, hypothyroid patients on LT4 (Levothyroxine) therapy who don't show much improvement may have lower brain thyroid levels (not reflected in their serum levels) correlated to the number of rs225014(C) alleles they carry, and these patients may benefit from combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy.  ""The Thr92AlaD2 Polymorphism May Play a Novel Role in Hypothyroidism"" by Elizabeth A McAninch, Antonio C Bianco, US Endocrinology, 2015;11(2):92–4 DOI: . This article stated ""A prevalent polymorphism in D2, Thr92AlaD2, has been associated with improved well-being on “combination therapy” with T4+T3; the underlying mechanism is unclear as T4-to-T3 conversion appears normal. Novel studies indicate this might be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. If the relationship between Thr92AlaD2-expression and treatment preference is confirmed, personalized medicine may play a role in hypothyroidism."" (Abstract)However, as of 2016, controversy continued about the value of testing for and treating polymorphisms of this SNP.  See the liothyronine page for further references.==Type 2 Diabetes==.

CYP1A2,Rs762551,"rs762551, also known as -164A>C or -163C>A, is a SNP encoding the CYP1A2*1F allele of the CYP1A2 gene. CYP1A2 is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of caffeine and some drugs.The baseline activity of the enzyme is similar in CYP1A2*1F allele carriers and non-carriers. However, rs762551(A) codes for the ""high inducibility"" form of the enzyme, characterized by higher enzyme activity in the presence of an inducer such as smoking or heavy coffee consumption . In non-smokers, there was no significant difference in CYP1A2 activity between the genotypes. In smokers, however, the A/A homozygotes had 1.6x higher CYP1A2 activity than A/C and C/C genotypes . Similarly, among non-smokers, only in heavy coffee consumers (more than 3 cups daily) the A/A homozygotes had about 1.4x higher CYP1A2 activity. There was no differences in CYP1A2 activity by genotype in non-heavy coffee consumers. A study of healthy premenopausal non-hormone using women concluded that drinkers of 3 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have lower breast volume (smaller breasts), but only if they had at least one rs762551(C) allele (p(interaction)=0.02), which was said to be consistent with reports that coffee protects only C-allele carriers against breast cancer.Another study by this same group looked at coffee consumption as related to breast cancer. Among 458 such patients (age 25-99 years), rs762551(A;A) women (about 1/2 of the total study) who drank 2 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have a later age at diagnosis compared with low coffee consumption (59.8 versus 52.6 years, p = 0.0004). These patients were also more likely to have ER- tumors than patients with low consumption (14.7% versus 0%, p = 0.018). Coffee consumption had no associations in carriers of a rs762551(C) allele.An independent study of 411 BRCA1 mutation carriers (170 cases and 241 controls) looked at the association between breast cancer, coffee consumption before age 35, and CYP1A2 genotype. While CYP1A2 genotype did not affect breast cancer risk, women with at least one rs762551(C) allele who consumed coffee had a 64% reduction in breast cancer risk, compared with women who never consumed coffee (odds ratio 0.36, CI: 0.18-0.73). No such protective effect was seen in rs762551(A;A) women.A study of 2,000 Costa Ricans who survived a first heart attack observed a general trend between coffee consumption and increased risk among carriers of rs762551(C) alleles, i.e. more coffee led to increased nonfatal heart attack risk. No association was seen for rs762551(A;A) individuals."

FCGR2A,Rs1801274,"rs1801274 is a SNP in the Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIa, receptor (CD32) FCGR2A gene. rs1801274(C) encodes the arginine (R) allele, with the (T) allele encoding the variant histidine (H). The (H) isoform is considered high-binding to IgG2 and IgG3, while the (R) isoform is considered low-binding. This SNP is known in the literature by many names, including A519C and H131R. What's the importance of this? FcgR isoforms expressed on immune system cells have been linked to the pathogenic consequences triggered by autoantibodies or immune complexes in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as to the efficacy of some immunotherapeutic treatments such as rituximab.Many studies have been published about this FCGR2A SNP, roughly divided by either disorder or treatment as follows:* HIV to AIDS, including susceptibility and progression** In a study of HIV-infected men, those with a FCGR2a CC genotype progressed to a CD4+ cell count of <200/mm3 at a faster rate than individuals with either of the other genotypes (relative hazard = 1.6; p = 0.0001). However, the authors noted that the progression to AIDS was less impacted by this SNP, largely because TT homozygotes had an increased risk of pneumonia as an AIDS-defining illness. * Lymphoma** A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. The AG and AA genotypes of rs1801274 were associated with higher risk of follicular and small lymphocytic lymphomas: 1.26x (95% CI, 1.01-1.56) and 1.41x (95% CI, 1.10-1.81), respectively (P(trend) = 0.006).*Hemophilia A**In a case-control study of 85 individuals a more than 3-fold increased risk of inhibitor development was found compared to patients with the RR genotype* Malaria** Based on a study of more than 1,800 individuals in India, rs1801274(T;T) homozgyotes were significantly associated with protection from disease manifestation, with stronger association observed in the malaria non-endemic region. * Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)** A study of 90 Japanese patients with SLE concluded that individuals with rs1801274(C) alleles were at higher risk for the disease. Classifying the reports by immunotherapeutic treatment studied yields the following:* Studies involving cetuximab:** In a study of 39 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab, the rs1801274(T) (ie H) allele was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.055), by perhaps 1-2 months. * Studies involving infliximab:** A study of 91 patients with rheumatoid arthritis found that at week 30 of treatment with infliximab, rs1801274(C;C) homozygotes had a better ACR20 response (RR: 60% and HH-RH: 33.3%; p= 0.035). * Studies involving rituximab:** In a study of 58 Croatian patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rs1801274 did not influence response, event-free or overall survival. * Studies involving 3F8, an anti-GD2 antibody:** In a study of 136 patients with high risk neuroblastoma treated with the anti-GD2 antibody 3F8 plus GM-CSF immunotherapy, the rs1801274(C;C)(ie R/R) genotype was correlated with progression-free survival for the entire cohort (p = .049) and for the subset of patients with no history of prior relapse (p = .023).

CYP2C9,Rs1799853,"rs1799853 is a SNP in the CYP2C9 gene and is linked to poor warfarin metabolism and risk of GI bleeding with some NSAID drugs. The common nomenclature for this polymorphism is CYP2C9*2 (Cys amino acid, T allele; the SNP is also known as C430T or Cys144Arg). Advanced knowledge of this may influence initial warfarin dosing by physicians. Warfarin is monitored through INR (international normalized ratio) and proper dosing is influenced by a variety of factors including warfarin metabolism and diet.  The rs1799853(T) allele encodes a variant amino acid, cysteine, which has been linked to poor metabolism of warfarin and thus sensitivity. The CYP2C9*2 allele is also associated with higher sensitivity to the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin. Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) mention concurrent testing for the HLA-B*15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN). The effect of CYP2C9 variants on drug metabolism should not be predicted without also considering CYP2C9*3, defined as the common loss of function variant rs1057910(C)  (NM_000771:c.430C>T, NP_000762:p.144R>C) /. In a 2009 article titled ""Genetically based impairment in CYP2C8- and CYP2C9-dependent NSAID metabolism as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding: is a combination of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics required to improve personalized medicine?"" Authors reviewed prior research that argued:*Individuals carrying minor alleles of this both CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 AND CYP2C8*3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) have increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib. *In addition, carriers of the risk allele for CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 have decreased metabolism of Ibuprofen, Flurbiprofen, Piroxicam, and Tenoxicam.  *The presence of CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 allele alone does not confer risk with Diclofenac, but when it is combined with CYP2C8*3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080), Diclofenac induces hepatoxicity and confers risk of GI bleeding.    In a 2008 article (reviewed in ) titled ""Interaction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes modifies the risk for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related acute gastrointestinal bleeding,"" the study discovered that carriers of CYP2C8*3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a GI bleeding event risk OR=1.81 (95% CI=0.95–3.46; P=0.071) and risk increased if carriers drank more than 20g alcohol/day to an OR=1.99 (95% CI=1.06–3.74; P=0.034). As CYP2C8*3 and CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium, patients are likely to carry the risk allele to both 8*3 and 9*2, and when they do, The OR (95% CI) for carriers of such a genotype is increased to 1.94 (1.13–3.33), P=0.017.   A 2013 NIH review titled ""PharmGKB summary: very important pharmacogene information for cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8"" reiterated that ""some data suggest that the combined presence of minor risk alleles CYP2C8*3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080) and CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 is a determinant of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding.""

GADL1,Rs17026651,"rs17026651 is a SNP in an intron of the GADL1 gene. This SNP is tightly linked to another intronic SNP, rs17026688, and both are linked to what appears to be the key variant, known as 'GADL1 IVS8+48delG' (rs201973599).  See rs17026688 for full details."
GADL1,Rs17026688,"rs17026688 is a SNP located in an intron of the glutamate decarboxylase-like 1 GADL1 gene. It is linked to rs17026651, and both are 100% linked to a 1 base deletion known as 'GADL1 IVS8+48delG' (rs201973599).In a study of ~1,700 patients of Han Chinese descent with bipolar disorder, researchers discovered that almost all of the patients who responded well to lithium treatment had at least one IVS8+48delG GADL1 allele. Initially, the researchers were focused on two nearby SNPs, rs17026688 and rs17026651, that turned out to be proxies (due to being in high linkage disequilibrium) for the deletion variant. rs17026688(T) is the ""response allele"", meaning that at least in these Asian patients, bipolar patients who are carriers of at least one (T) allele are predicted to respond well to lithium treatment; rs17026688(C;C) patients are predicted to respond poorly.The odds ratios and probabilities for this study are so high that the authors are able to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV; NPV) for the connection between this DNA variant and being a bipolar patient who will respond well (or not) to lithium treatment. In a pooled cohort of ~400 patients, roughly divided equally between those responding well to lithium or not, the odds ratios, p values, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were around 80, 1 x 10e-50, 93%, 87%, 83% and 95%, respectively. To put it another way, while overall about half of all patients had a response allele and half didn't, only 1 in 14 patients who responded well to lithium lacked a response allele, and only 1 in 8 of those who did not respond well had a response allele. The authors naturally suggest the use of these SNPs as useful biomarkers for which patients with bipolar disorder will respond well to lithium treatment, and they also intend to (1) look for additional GADL1 gene variants acting similarly, especially in non-Asian populations given the rarity of this particular deletion variant outside of Asian population, and (2) see if these variants influence lithium treatment outcomes in other affective disorders such as major depressive disorder."

For more details, see rs17026688, a SNP in complete linkage with it."
SMN2,Rs4916,"This SNP is discussed in the discussion of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA); it is a SNP theoretically found in exon 7 of the SMN1 gene.In a world with perfect analytic tests, there would be 3 possible genotypes most likely to arise from this SNP: (-;-), (-;C), and (C;C), indicated spinal muscular atrophy patients, carriers for SMA, and non-carriers, respectively.However, due to the presence of identical flanking sequences to either side of this location in the genome for the near identical gene SMN2, an imperfect test can yield a (T;T) genotype for this SNP, which is really just a read of the SMN2 gene sequence at this location.Test that determine the ratio of what could be called rs4916(C) to rs4916(T) ""alleles"" may be possible to determine dosage ratio between SMN1 and SMN2.

HLA-B,Rs2395029,"rs2395029 is a SNP in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, and several studies have shown that the rs2395029(G) allele is 99.9% predictive of the presence of an HLA-B*5701 allele in many (but not all) Caucasian and Hispanic populations. This HLA allele, in turn, has been associated with several conditions.A study of 51 cases of flucloxacillin drug-induced liver injury (DILI), an important cause of serious liver disease, along with a replication study of another 23 cases, found that the rs2395029(G) carriers were at highly increased risk (odds ratio 80, p=8.7x10(-33)).* see also: / 23andMe blog rs2395029(G;G) increases the odds of drug-induced liver injury in response to flucloxacillin by 45x This SNP is thought to be involved in determining the HIV viral load set point during the asymptomatic period of infection. This SNP is estimated to explain 9.6% of the total variation in the viral set point.Humans show remarkable variation in vulnerability to infection by HIV-1 and especially in the clinical outcome following infection. One striking and largely unexplained difference is the level of circulating virus in the plasma during the non-symptomatic phase preceding progression to AIDS. This is known as the ''viral set point'' and can vary among individuals by as much as 4 to 5 logs. The HCP5 (HLA complex P5) gene is located 100 kb centromeric from HLAB on chromosome 6.  HCP5 is a good candidate to interact with HIV-1, possibly through an antisense mechanism. Moreover, HCP5 is predicted to encode two proteins, and the associated polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution in one of these.rs9264942 is also reported to be associated with reduced HIV viral load set point.In most European populations, the rs2395029(G) allele is in tight linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 1) with the HLA-B*5701 allele, and therefore is predictive of hypersensitivity to the drug abacavir, an antiviral used to treat HIV+ individuals. However, the linkage between rs2395029 and HLA-B*57:01 is not well studied in African and Asian populations, and in one Italian population, the linkage is questionable.. nature Abacavir hypersensitivity rs2395029 rs2395029 reported to be associated with psoriasis in a large US/UK study rs2395029 was found to be associated with psoriasis based on a study by the eMERGE network in which electronic medical records were searched to find clinical associations associated with selected SNPs.

It has also been linked to how well a patient responds to Viagra (sildenafil). Several studies have been unable to replicate one or more of the associations in at least some populations between this SNP and these conditions. The more notable studies include:*rs5443(T) allele carriers are 2-3 fold more likely to be obese in Caucasian, Chinese, and African American populations. *rs5443(T) carriers are clearly at higher risk for hypertension, but this review indicates that whether they are also at increased risk for stroke and left ventricular hypertrophy remains controversial. *rs5443(T;T) women gain significantly more weight during pregnancy than rs5443(C;T) or rs5443(C;C) women, and had a significantly higher pre-pregnancy body mass index.  *rs5443(T;T) genotypes respond to Viagra better. 91% of them have a ""positive erectile response"" upon taking Viagra, whereas only around 50% of rs5443(C;T) and rs5443(C;C) individuals respond equivalently to the drug.

TF,Rs1049296,"rs1049296, also known as Pro570Ser, is best known as the basis for the C1/C2 subtypes of the transferrin TF gene. The rs1049296(C) allele encodes the C1 subtype, and the rarer rs1049296(T) allele encodes the C2 subtype.Involved in the transport of iron,  transferrin and its subtypes have been linked at times to various conditions, perhaps most notably Alzheimer's disease. One meta-analyis of 19 studies with 6310 cases and 13661 controls concluded that the C2 allele, rs1049296(T), was associated with slightly increased risk for Alzheimer's, with odds ratios around 1.1-1.2. Pathogens may scavenge iron, and the body's attempts to sequester it from such pathogens are a form of defense termed nutritional immunity. One explanation for the presence of the C2 TF subtype in humans is that it may reduce the effectiveness of some bacterial transferrin binding proteins./"

For multiple reasons discussed below, interpretation of the impact of this SNP is highly problematic.In addition to the reporting discrepancies between two different DTC labs (AncestryDNA and 23andMe) discussed below, the ClinVar record is decidedly mixed about whether this is, or is not, a pathogenic mutation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. After initially being classified of uncertain significance in 2011 by LabCorp, it was classified as benign in 2013 by both an NIH lab and by GeneDx, but in 2014, GeneDx re-classified it as pathogenic. Furthermore, in a dissertation published in July 2015 for a Masters in Genetic Counseling , rs11570112 was discussed in depth as a variant with conflicting interpretation between ClinVar and labs in the SHaRe academic consortium specializing in cardiomyopathy diagnosis /, citing one group as saying it was benign and the other of uncertain significance.AncestryDNA seems to report the common genotype for this SNP on OpenSNP as C,C on the plus strand, which shows up as G,G on the minus strand in Promethease.  23andme seems to report the common genotype for this SNP as GG on the plus strand, which shows up as C,C on the minus strand on Promethease.  This is an ambiguous flip (C/G).  Th first 10 or so C,C checked on OpenSNP were all AncestyDNA reports, and given the extremely low frequency of the pathogenic allele, this is most likely an ambiguous flip problem.  AncestryDNA users with a homozygous ""pathogenic"" GG reported by Promethease seem more likely to be wild type.  Additionally, both C,C and G,G are far more common on OpenSNP than C,G, which deviates from Hardy-Weinberg.  Additionally, newer 23andme (v4) microarrays do not seem to report any data for this SNP at all."

In Asian (Japanese) populations, the presence of an rs3087243(G) allele represents a 1.3 fold increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease, and for those with autoimmune thyroid disease, a 1.5 fold increased risk of type-1 diabetes. However, in individuals without autoimmune thyroid disease, no association was seen between this SNP and type-1 diabetes. The authors speculate that earlier studies may have reported associations between this SNP and type-1 diabetes that were actually primarily based on the association with autoimmune thyroid disease.This same SNP, rs3087243, has also been implicated as a (minor) risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A study of 2,000+ European RA patients led to a calculated odds ratio of 1.13 (CI: 1.03 - 1.24) for the rs3087243(G) risk allele.

CBLB,Rs3772534,"One report based on a study of 480 Danish families indicated that the rs3772534 SNP in the CBLB gene indicated an increased risk for developing type 1 diabetes, and that there might be co-inheritance with the rs3087243 SNP found in the CTLA4 gene. However, a subsequent study based on over 2,000 parent-child trios (ie families) failed to find any evidence of either effect."
GATA3,Rs4143094,"'''rs4143094''' is a SNP identified by a genome-wide diet-gene interaction analysis (GxE), and was found to be associated with increased risk of colon cancer correlated to the dietary variable of processed meat consumption. It is located on chromosome 10p14, 7.2kb upstream of GATA binding protein 3 (''GATA3''), in the promoter region of the gene  rs4143094 was identified in a screen of 2.7 million SNPs for the risk of colorectal cancer, by combining 10 studies comparing 9287 cases and 9117 controls. Data was obtained from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and analyzed by conventional case-control logistic regression for multiplicative interactions between SNPs and dietary factors. rs4143094 was the most significantly implicated SNP in 10p14 for processed meat consumption linked with occurrence of colorectal cancer. The risk allele (T) has an ORinteraction=1.17, p=8.73E-09 with evidenced heterogenetity by p=0.78. When stratifying by genotype, rs4143094-TG has OR=1.2, 95% CI=1.13-1.26; rs4143094-TT has an OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.22-1.59; and the minor/null genotype rs4143094-GG has an OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.98-1.07.  Several other SNPs in the 10p14 region were correlated to the same phenotype, (rs485411, risk allele C, ORinteraction=1.18; Pinteraction=1.72E-08; rs1269486, risk allele A, ORinteraction=1.18, Pinteraction=7.53E-08) though rs4143094 was highlighted due to having the most significant P-value.Colorectal cancer is the third most leading cause of cancer death in men and women , and consumption of processed meat has been linked to increased risk of its development , . rs4143094 is upstream of ''GATA3'', a gene associated with Th2 cell differentiation , which is upregulated in ulcerative colitis , a risk factor for colorectal cancer . Though the mechanism by which ''GATA3'' suppression may lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer is unknown, its suppression has been previously linked to breast, colorectal, and lung cancers . DOJ  Association between risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat.rs4143094 on chromosome 10p14 is about 7.2kb upstream of GATA3 gene. GATA3 belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors. Its functional role includes regulation of luminal epithelial cell differentiation, development of T cell, and differentiation of T helper (Th) cell. Genes in the GATA family are involved in several types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and of particular interest to this entry, colorectal cancer    . According to dbSNP, rs4143094 has two alleles, G (major allele) and T (minor allele). The minor allele has a frequency of 0.2337 across all populations. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), using data from Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), discovered a strong correlation between rs4143094 and risk of colorectal cancer when ingesting red and processed meat . In the study, approximately 2.7M SNPs were tested across 9,287 case and 9,117 control subjects, all with European ancestry. The result shows that rs4143094 is associated with risk of colorectal cancer (P = 8.73e-9), with T being the risk allele. Specifically, individuals with TG and TT genotypes are increased for occurrence of colorectal cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 and 1.39, respectively. rs4143094 resides in a 9.5 kb linkage-disequilibrium (LD) block (r2 > 0.8) containing 19 highly correlated SNPs. The third most significant among these SNPs, rs1269486, is located 1420 bases upstream of GATA3 and is in a region of open chromatin (DNA hypersensitivity). Experimental evidence suggests binding activity of Pol2 and transcription factors c-Fos, JunD, and c-Jun in this region . Many other SNPs in the LD block reside in GATA3-antisense RNA1 (GATA3-AS1).  GATA3-AS1 may regulate GATA3 transcript activity, although further experimental evidence is required. Apart from the SNP, this study also observed that red and processed meat consumption increases risk for colorectal cancer with OR of 1.15 and 1.11, respectively. For this secondary result, the author proposed the following pathway: processed meat triggers pro-tumorigenic inflammatory or immunological response, whose recovery depends upon the expression of GATA3 gene. Further experimental evidence is required to confirm this hypothesis."
GATA3,Rs570613,"A study of 6,388 cases and 4,995 controls from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and 5,617 BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) concluded that there is no evidence that rs570613 is associated with breast cancer risk in women."

IL10,Rs1800896,"This SNP is upstream of the IL10 gene, and is also known as the -1082G>A IL10 SNP. Dust mite exposure modifies the effect of functional IL10 polymorphisms on allergy and asthma exacerbations.Dust mite exposure significantly modified the relation between 3 SNPs in IL10 (rs1800896, rs3024492, and rs3024496). Homozygosity for the minor allele of each of the 3 SNPs was associated with increased risk of occurrence ( approximately 3-fold to 39-fold increase).A study of 258 prostate cancer cases concluded that the rs1800896(A) allele, known to result in lower levels of this anti-inflammatory cytokine, was positively associated with risk (AG vs. GG, odds ratio of 1.69, CI: 1.10-2.60; AA vs. GG, OR of 1.81, CI: 1.11-2.96)."

IL10,Rs3024490,"According to a 2010 report, each A (minor) allele at rs3024490 in the IL10 gene increased the risk of Beh&#231;et's disease about 1.4 times in a Turkish population.   The aim of the study was to map SNP/gene associations with environmental pathogen-richness in relation to genomic variations across geographic human populations. This 2009 article found that ""six risk alleles for inflammatory bowel (IBD) or celiac disease are significantly correlated with micropathogen richness. These data support the hygiene hypothesis for IBD and provide a large set of putative targets for susceptibility to helminth infections."" (Abstract) Table I. identified rs3024490 among a list of 44 SNPs analyzed in relation to micro- and macro-pathogens. This SNP was not previously associated with IBD and celiac disease and was negatively associated with pathogen richness.  This 2009 study identified a haplotype among Ghanaians consisting of minor alleles at four SNPs in the IL-10 gene: rs1800871, rs1800872, rs3024490 and rs1554286. This combination of risk alleles led to lower IL-10 expression and higher TNF gene expression, resulting in a pro-inflammatory response. The authors explain that in Ghana, ""pro-inflammatory alleles rescue their carriers of excess mortality in adverse environmental conditions"" such as drinking from boreholes, and thus minor alleles occur more frequently in African populations, but ""in an affluent environment, the same pro-inflammatory response leads to increased mortality,"" and minor alleles occur much less frequently (i.e. in Caucasian populations)."

LRRK2,Rs34637584,"First discovered in 2004, rs34637584 is a SNP indicating a position within the LRRK2 that encodes a variant protein. This SNP is commonly referred to as the G2019S variant (or, mutation) based on the potential change from glycine (encoded by rs34637584(G) allele) to serine (encoded by the rs34637584(A) allele) at position 2019 of the LRRK2 protein.Note: as of June 2016, we have noticed that this SNP is prone to being miscalled in AncestryDNA V2.0 datasets.One copy of a rs34637584(A) allele is sufficient to greatly increase one's risk for Parkinson's disease. It is considered a disease causing mutation because it is rarely found in healthy, elderly people without Parkinson's disease, and it has been found in both familial and sporadic types of the disease. While there are many different SNPs that can influence one's risk for Parkinson's disease, rs34637584 is an especially common cause of the disease in Berber Arabs and Ashkenazi Jews. Overall, the risk of Parkinson's disease for a person who inherits a rs34637584(A) allele is 28% at age 59, 51% at 69, and 74% at 79, according to the International LRRK2 Consortium.This SNP  has been associated with disease at varying frequencies in Asian (<1%), European (1%&#8211;7%), North American (1%&#8211;3%), North African (34-41%), and Ashkenazi (10&#8211;25%) sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease patient populations .The G2019S mutation is also common not only in Parkinson's disease patients but also in controls at a frequency of 2.2% in North African Berber-Arabs (13/597, ), 1.4% in Sephardic Jews (5/361, ) and 1.3% in Ashkenazic Jews (4/317, ) while it is found at a very low frequency of 0.06% in Europeans (1/1550, ) and not found in sub-Saharan Africans.Individuals with G2019S who share the most common haplotype (mainly Europeans, Jews and North-Africans) very likely share a common ancestor estimated to have lived 1,525&#8211;1,830 years ago between the second and fifth centuries A.D. either in the Middle East  or in  North Africa . In contrast, other authors hypothesized that LRRK2 G2019S might be of Phoenician origin, rather than Arabic-Berber or Jewish, dating from the founding of ancient Carthage in 814 B.C. . G2019S has been observed on two additional background haplotypes (one in European&#8211;Americans and one in Japanese) distinct from the main one observed in Europeans, North-Africans and Jews. This suggests that G2019S has arisen independently on at least three separate occasions. According to the most extensive and thorough study by Lesage et al. in 2010, estimations indicated that the LRRK2 mutation on the main haplotype initially arose among Near-Easterners at least 4,000 years ago, much earlier than in previous estimations. Because of a founder effect, the ancestors of present-day Ashkenazi Jews may have kept the low-frequency G2019S mutation through the different diasporas, whereas Near Eastern daughter populations lost the mutation. ""The mutation might then have been reintroduced by recurrent gene flow from Ashkenazi populations to other Jewish, European and North-African populations. The present-day frequency of the mutation in control populations (0.05% in Europeans, 0.5% in North-African Arabs and 1% in Ashkenazi Jews) may support this scenario""Is a carrier of at least one rs34637584(A) allele definitely going to develop Parkinson's disease if they live long enough? No. Several studies have found that overall the odds of developing the disease for G2019S carriers depends on age, family history, and ethnicity. The odds for G2019S carriers were calculated to be 15% at 60 years, 21% at 70 years, and 32% at 80 years in a study of Italian patients , whereas in a Jewish population the age-specific odds were 24% at age 80.Having a family history of Parkinson's disease in addition to carrying a rs34637584(A) allele is also associated with increased risk for the disease.Do the odds differ between carriers of one and two rs34637584(A) alleles? Apparently not; a study of North Africans - one of the few populations likely to have sufficient numbers of homozygote rs34637584(A;A) individuals to study due to the rarity of the mutation - there was no clinical difference between Parkinson's disease patients carrying one or two copies, and, 3 individuals (ranging from 42-70 years old) who were rs34637584(A;A) and yet did not have the disease were also observed.In 2019, a study concluded that compared to Parkinson patients due to other causes, G2019S-associated Parkinson patients had a ~10-fold higher chance of developing leukemia and a 2-fold higher chance of developing colon cancer, perhaps thereby meriting additional screening for those conditions. However, it was not clear if higher odds would have been seen in G2019S-carriers compared to healthy individuals not carrying the G2019S mutation.This SNP was in the news  in 2008 as one of Google's founders, Sergey Brin, announced that he and his mother (who has Parkinson's disease) both carry the G2019S SNP. Mr. Brin was 35 years old at the time of the announcement, and in his / blog, he comments that ""I now have the opportunity to adjust my life to reduce those odds"", which he states are ""somewhere between 20% to 80% depending on the study and how you measure"". Helixgene discusses this  extensively and concludes that people with G2019S have about a 25% chance of Parkinson's disease in their lifetime. This chance is greatly influenced by other factors including ethnicity and family history. BMC in LRRK2 is not fully penetrant in familial Parkinson's Disease and  commentarygs248 is relevant"
