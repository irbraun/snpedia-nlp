ABCG2,Rs2231137,"rs2231137, also known as Val12Met, is a SNP in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2 ABCG2 gene. The (G) allele encodes the Val.In a study of incident ischemic stroke during 14 years of follow-up in a population-based study of older adults known as the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), rs2231137 was associated with stroke in both white (hazard ratio, 1.46, CI: 1.05 - 2.03) and black (hazard ratio, 3.59, CI, 1.11 - 11.6) participants. The risk of ischemic stroke was higher in Val allele homozygotes than in Met allele carriers. The adjusted hazard ratio for Val allele homozygotes, compared with Met allele carriers, was 1.50 (90% CI, 1.06 to 2.12) in whites and 3.62 (90% CI, 1.11 to 11.9) in black participants (Table 4). Because nearly 90% of whites and blacks are Val homozygotes, the Met allele could also be considered as a protective allele."
ABCG2,Rs2231142,"rs2231142, also known as Q141K and C421A, is a SNP in the ABCG2 gene, indicating a missense variant.  ""Our data indicate that at least 10% of all gout cases in whites are attributable to this causal variant.""A is the risk allele. A large study totaling 7,699 participants in the Framingham cohort and 4,148 participants in the Rotterdam cohort was conducted, with genome-wide significant SNPs then replicated in 11,000+ Caucasian and ~4,000 African-American individuals who took part in the study of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC). This study calculated an odds ratio of 1.74 for rs2231142 (CI: 1.51-1.99, p = 3.3x10e-15). A genetic score comprised of this SNP plus 2 others may stratify risk for gout. Among non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib, there's a 4-5x higher risk of diarrhea for rs2231142 heterozygotes (and presumably minor allele homozygotes), based on a study of 124 patients treated with 250mg oral gefitinib once daily.rs2231142 also appears to influence the effectiveness of rosuvastatin.

The risk is independent of the risk posed by another ABCG2 gene SNP, rs2231142, since these two SNPs are on different haplotypes. Both ABCG2 SNPs are, however, associated with the ROL gout subtype, defined as when urinary urate excretion (UUE) is over 25.0 mg/h/1.73 m2 (600 mg/day/1.73 m2) and urate clearance (urate clearance/creatinine clearance ratio, FEUA) is 5.5% or over."

Functional studies showed that this SNP selectively reduced carbamazepine transport across the cell membrane."
ABCC2,Rs3740065,"rs3740065 is a SNP in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 2 ABCC2 gene.A study of 282 hormone receptor-positive, invasive breast cancer Japanese patients receiving tamoxifen found a significant association with shorter recurrence-free survival (p = .00017; hazard ratio 10.64, CI: 1.44 - 78.88) in rs3740065(T;T) patients; the hazard ratio for carriers of one (T) allele was 3.5 (CI: 0.5-26). Curiously, no significant difference in plasma levels of the tamoxifen metabolites endoxifen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen were seen.This same study of tamoxifen users concluded that rs3740065(T;T) patients who also had two CYP2D6 risk alleles had a 45 fold higher risk of recurrence than patients with zero or one (out of the possible four) risk alleles. The overall average recurrence risk was 5x for carriers of a total of two risk alleles, and 20x for carriers of a total of three risk alleles.A nearby SNP, rs11190303, also showed significant association to recurrence-free survival; it was shown to be strongly linked to rs3740065 (r2 with LD of 0.79)."

ABCB1,Rs2032582,"rs2032582, also known as G2677T, is a nonsynonymous SNP located in exon 21 of the ABCB1 gene. G2677 is also known as Ala893Thr. It is often studied in conjunction with rs1045642.The rs2032582(T) variant allele yields a 2.6 fold higher risk of developing lung cancer, and in particular, the type of lung cancer called squamous cell carcinoma (CI 1.7-4.0, P < .001) in white Spanish smokers. There appears to be little gene dosage effect, since homozygous rs2032582(T;T) carriers shoulder almost all the risk (odds ratio 6.75 compared to (A;A) homozygotes, CI 3.0-15.2). This risk is also the same in light or heavy smokers.  A study of 98 methadone-maintaining patients concluded that the higher (>150 mg/day) and lower (< or =150 mg/day) methadone dose groups differed significantly in their rs1128503 status (experiment-wise p = 0.0325). Furthermore, individuals with the 3-locus genotype pattern (T;T)-(T;T)-(T;T) for SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503, respectively, had an approximately 5-fold chance of requiring the 'higher' methadone dose, while individuals heterozygous for these three SNPs have an approximately 3-fold chance of stabilizing at the 'lower' methadone dose (point-wise p-value = 0.026).OMIM also reports an association with Crohn's disease."
ABCB1,Rs2032583,"rs2032583 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and newer antidepressant drugs ,. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is to be confirmed. A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2032583(C) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates had better chances on remission. However,could not be reproduced in a large (~900) -trial with outpatient with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , the significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome among all studies with this SNP becomes insignificant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. However, the association remained significant after Bonferroni-correction in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients.rs2032583 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele.

Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors PMID 28648553 and newer antidepressant drugs ,.  However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is still to be confirmed. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect on depression outcome and eight - that they do not. However those 18 studies are difficult to compare because they vary within their study design concerning following factors: population (ethnicity, psychiatric condition), tested SNPs, tested antidepressants (Pgp substrates and Pgp non-substrates) and doses, inclusion of drug metabolism monitoring and statistical correction for multiple testing.A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2235015(T) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates were more likely to remit. However, this result could not be reproduced in a large (N~900) trial with outpatients with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1).

ACTC1,Rs193922680,"rs193922680, also known as c.301G>A, p.Glu101Lys and E101K, is a rare mutation in the ACTC1 gene on chromosome 15.Inherited as an autosomal dominant, it reportedly leads to a form of left ventricular noncompaction.The rare minor allele of this variant is reported to be pathogenic/likely pathogenic for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), according to .See OMIM  102540.0009"

Homozygote minor or compound heterozygote mutation involving this mutation leads to the inborn error of metabolism medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, aka MCAD deficiency. This particular mutation (rs7791234C) is the common MCADD mutation among Northern European Caucasians, being present in about 80% of Caucasian individuals who presented clinically with MCADD and in 60% of the population identified by screening.See also OMIM  607008.0001FTDNA & MyHeritage name: VG01S107723andMe name: i5012759"

Moyamoya, a rare disease in which arteries at the base of the brain are blocked, usually strikes in childhood but can occur in adults. Strokes or ministrokes (transient ischemic attacks) are often the first symptoms of the condition."
