ABCB1,Rs10248420,"rs10248420 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is unconfirmed. In clinic, even the lower concentrations of drugs may achieve sufficient antidepressant effect, and the dose of the drug can be adjusted upwards until the patient responds. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect in depression and eight that they do not. rs10248420 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele. The list of the 9 SNPs is shown below.When treated for depression with citalopram, paroxetine, amitriptyline, or venlafaxine (substrates of the protein encoded by ABCB1), a highly statistically significant association between the overall genetic variability of these SNPs and remission was reported by Uhr et al in a study of ~400 German inpatients.. However, this result has to be treated with caution. A well-run, double-blind study of ABCB1 substrate citalopram in depression (STAR-D study) and a following meta-analysis  failed to replicate several Uhr et al. results for other ABCB1 SNPs.The 9 SNPs in the linkage block identified are :* rs2235067* rs4148740* rs2032583* rs4148739* rs11983225* rs2235040* rs12720067* rs7787082* rs10248420 rs10248420 and rs2032583 associated with colonic disease Identifying candidate causal variants responsible for altered activity of the ABCB1 multidrug resistance gene."
ABCB1,Rs1045642,"rs1045642, also known as C3435T, is a SNP located in the ABCB1 gene. It is often studied in conjunction with rs2032582.

ABCB1,Rs2032582,"rs2032582, also known as G2677T, is a nonsynonymous SNP located in exon 21 of the ABCB1 gene. G2677 is also known as Ala893Thr. It is often studied in conjunction with rs1045642.The rs2032582(T) variant allele yields a 2.6 fold higher risk of developing lung cancer, and in particular, the type of lung cancer called squamous cell carcinoma (CI 1.7-4.0, P < .001) in white Spanish smokers. There appears to be little gene dosage effect, since homozygous rs2032582(T;T) carriers shoulder almost all the risk (odds ratio 6.75 compared to (A;A) homozygotes, CI 3.0-15.2). This risk is also the same in light or heavy smokers.

ABCB1,Rs2032583,"rs2032583 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and newer antidepressant drugs ,. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is to be confirmed. A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2032583(C) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates had better chances on remission. However,could not be reproduced in a large (~900) -trial with outpatient with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , the significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome among all studies with this SNP becomes insignificant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. However, the association remained significant after Bonferroni-correction in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients.rs2032583 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele.

SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors PMID 28648553 and newer antidepressant drugs ,.  However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is still to be confirmed. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect on depression outcome and eight - that they do not. However those 18 studies are difficult to compare because they vary within their study design concerning following factors: population (ethnicity, psychiatric condition), tested SNPs, tested antidepressants (Pgp substrates and Pgp non-substrates) and doses, inclusion of drug metabolism monitoring and statistical correction for multiple testing.A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2235015(T) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates were more likely to remit. However, this result could not be reproduced in a large (N~900) trial with outpatients with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , no significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome with this SNP among all studies, but the association remained significant in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients. rs2235015 is near the 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele.

ABCB1,Rs7787082,"rs7787082 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is unconfirmed. In clinic, even the lower concentrations of drugs may achieve sufficient antidepressant effect, and the dose of the drug can be adjusted upwards until the patient responds.

ABCA7,Rs4147929,"rs4147929 is a SNP in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), member 7 ABCA7 gene.rs4147929 has been reported in a large study (IGAP) to be associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.15 (CI 1.11-1.19),"
ABCA7,Rs72973581,"A sequencing study of 332 sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases identified this ABCA7 coding variant, rs72973581(A), also known as p.G215S, as conferring a modest but statistically significant protection against the disorder (OR 0.57, CI: 0.41-0.8, p = 0.024)."

ABCA7,Rs78117248,"Sequencing of the ABCA7 gene in a Belgian cohort of 700+ patients with Alzheimer's disease led to the association of the rare rs78117248(G) allele with increased risk (odds ratio 2.07, CI: 1.31-3.27, p=0.0016)."
AANAT,Rs28936679,"rs28936679, also known as Ala129Thr or A129T (and also G619A), is a SNP in the aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase AANAT gene. The AANAT protein plays a unique role in vertebrate biology by controlling rhythmic production of melatonin in the pineal gland. Its activity increases 10- to 100-fold at night, leading to increased production and release of melatonin.In a 2003 report about Japanese patients with a sleep disorder known as susceptibility to delayed sleep phase syndrome, patient genotypes had a higher frequency of the rs28936679(A) allele.A later report based on Brazilian (primarily Caucasian) patients including those with delayed sleep phase syndrome found no variation at this SNP."
