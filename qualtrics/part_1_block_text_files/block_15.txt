The TSLP protein plays a role in inflammation of cells in the trachea and alveoli therefore may have a causative role in certain types of asthma. The rs1837253(T) allele has been found to reduce the risk of developing late-onset (adult) asthma in several studies, and it is recognized by the CPMC Study as one they report to their participants.</p>

Risk for nicotine dependence and lung cancer is conferred by mRNA expression levels and amino acid change in CHRNA5.

Nonetheless, a 2014 report based on 138 patients concludes that rs2832407(C;C) individuals show a greater decrease than non-carriers (of a rs2832407(C) allele) in the number of heavy drinking days per week when taking topiramate at a dose of 200 mg/daily.
