    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1683">rs1801028 is a SNP in the dopamine D2 receptor DRD2 gene. A meta-analysis comprising 27 samples and over 3,707 schizophrenia patients concluded that Cys/Ser heterozygotes, i.e. rs1801028(C;G) genotypes, were at elevated risk for schizophrenia when compared to either homozygote genotype (rs1801028(C;C) or rs1801028(G;G)). The odds ratio was 1.4 (p<0.005). An earlier meta-analysis comprising over 9,000 schizophrenia patients concluded pretty much the same thing: the Cys311 (rs1801028(G)) allele frequency led to an odds ratio of 1.43 (CI: 1.16-1.78, p<0.001) for this risk allele. A study of ~120 Chinese patients with schizophrenia concluded that Cys/Ser heterozygotes may not respond to risperidone treatment as well as Ser/Ser homozygotes.A paper has been published describing mistakes made in assigning allele status for this SNP:  (free full text) Misassigned alleles can annihilate efforts to control quality in otherwise well-designed genetic association analyses. To date, the issue remains underreported, as is exemplified by studies of a diallelic DRD2 missense variant in schizophrenia. For this variant, allele frequency data have been either misassigned, or incorrectly cited on four consecutive occasions. Contrary to conjecture, low heterozygosity has not guarded against the error with regard to rs1801028, a SNP that features a canonical base pair transversion, G:C.In the case of rs1801028, rs1801028(C) is the more common allele, encoding the amino acid Serine at position 311, whereas rs1801028(G) encodes Cysteine.</p>

The more common allele (G) has been linked to increased risk; alternatively, this could be seen as implying that the less common (A) allele reduces cluster headache risk.In the (first) study, 100+ Italian patients were analyzed to reveal that rs2653349(G;G) genotypes were at 5x increased risk for the disorder, compared with (A;G) and (A;A) genotypes. A study of 200+ German patients indicated that (G;G) homozygotes were at 2x increased risk (CI: 1.32-2.92, p = 0.0007) for cluster headaches.A meta-analysis of 3 pooled studies concluded that the rs2653349(G;G) genotype showed a higher disease risk compared to the remaining genotypes (odds ratio 1.69, CI:1.11-2.58).Not all studies have found this association; a study of Northern Europeans did not find an association.Also, a study has been performed to find out if treatment success for cluster headaches is correlated with rs2653349 genotype. Among 184 Caucasian patients, while the rs2653349(G) allele was significantly associated with cluster headaches, treatment outcomes with triptans, oxygen, verapamil and corticosteroids were not.Independently, a study has been performed to see if rs2653349 might be associated with migraine; in this study at least, the answer was no.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4886">Several tightly linked SNPs in the STAT4 gene have been linked to risk for risk haplotype for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The strongest association is found for either of two perfectly linked SNP alleles, rs10181656(G) and rs7582694(C), both yielding an odds ratio of 1.71 in this study of ~700 Swedish SLE patients.The risk for SLE was also calculated to increase as a function of the total number of risk alleles for this SNP plus 2 others in the IRF5 gene, rs10488631 and a CGGGG indel, rs77571059. Compared to individuals with 0 or 1 risk alleles, the risk for SLE increased 1.82-fold for each additional risk allele from this group. The odds ratio for SLE is 2.08 (CI: 1.53-2.83) for carriers of 2 risk alleles, and goes up to 13.0 (CI: 3.78-44.3) for carriers of 5 or 6 risk alleles (compared to those with 0 or 1).

(p = 9 x 10(-11)) was associated with an odds ratio of 4.06 (confidence interval 2.81-14.69)However, a separate study of 1,749 Alzheimer patients concluded that this GAB2 SNP is "at best a minor genetic determinant" since the authors of this study observed only a slight tendency for an increase of the (G;G) genotype (odds ratio of 1.3 vs (G;T) and (T;T), CI:1.0-1.6, p=0.09) and for an increase in the G allele frequency (odds ratio 1.3, CI:1.0-1.6, p=0.05) in ApoE4-carriers.   A new (Dec 2008) meta-analysis concludes that, yes, indeed, rs2373115 is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease among ApoE4 carriers, with an odds ratio of 1.58 (CI: 1.17 - 2.14, p = 3 x 10e-3), but only among carriers. This meta-analysis pooled published studies with a new study of 443 AD cases.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3241">SNP rs3025058 was first described in 1995 as a variant upstream of, and influencing the regulation of, the MMP3 gene. Most commonly, the version of this SNP with a run of 5 A's is called the 5A allele, and an allele with 6 A's is called 6A. Thus, the homozygous genotypes are either 5A/5A or 6A/6A, and the heterozygote genotype is published as 5A/6A. Incidentally, the MMP3 gene is also called stromelysin-1, and although there is a SNP in dbSNP in the orientation that shows the polynucleotide run as A's (rs35068180) the entry that has population frequency data is the one discussed here, rs3025058, which is from the other strand and thus shows the string as T's.There have been numerous studies in the last 10+ years linking either the 5A or 6A allele to risk for myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease. A relatively recent meta-analysis combining seven previously published studies concluded that the 5A allele is indeed a plaque-disrupting risk factor (odds ratio 1.26, CI: 1.1 - 1.4, p<0.001), while the 6A allele is associated with greater progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the 6A/6A genotype is associated with a worse progression of coronary artery disease after angioplasty. However, all these studies show a lot of heterogeneity, and gender, age, and ethnicity are all likely to alter the influence of these alleles.  rs1799864(G), rs3025058(A) and rs662 were associated with increased risk, and rs1800775(A) with reduced risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism no influence on varicose veins</p>

Canavan disease is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. It is a childhood onset disease which begins in early infancy. It is characterized by disordered muscular behavior (e.g., hypotonia, hyperextension) and neurological symptoms, such as blindness, developmental and cognitive delays. The neurological findings appear to be due to demyelination and leukodystrophy. Histology indicates the presence of spongy degeneration; cytology confirms astrocytic swelling of normal neurons and abnormality of astrocyte mitochondria.  Ultimately, sufferers become extremely ill and die on average at 18 months of age.rs28940279 is a SNP in the aspartoacylase ASPA gene.   The A-C transversion results in a substitution of alanine, a hydrophobic small-chain amino acid, for a glutamate (which is both large and charged). This substitution, E285A, is at a residue predicted to be part of the catalytic domain of aspartocyclase. This missense mutation is predicted to have drastic effects on the catalytic domain because of the vast difference between the amino acids.In particular, this substitution is common in Ashkenazi Jews, with carrier frequency approximately 1 in 60 individuals.  This suggests that some degree of founder effect is responsible for its prevalence within the Ashkenazi Jewish population. In particular, one study suspects that the mutation originated in the Vilna area, in Poland or Lithuania depending on the political timeperiod of origin.  This suggests that it is a newer variant than others found in the more broad European population.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1606">rs70991108 is a polymorphism consisting of a 19-bp deletion in the first intron of the dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene. The wild-type (non-deletion) allele is a bit more common than the deletion allele in most populations. Several studies have linked this SNP to alterations in folic acid (and folate) metabolism. A study of 1,215 subjects  from the Framingham Offspring Study concluded that rs70991108 influences the prevalence of circulating folic acid levels. Specifically, folic acid intake over 500ug/d led to high circulating (unmetabolized) folic acid levels in subjects homozygous for the deletion genotype. When folic acid intake was under 250ug/d, the deletion/deletion homozygotes had lower RBC folate (732.2 nmol/L) compared with the non-deletion genotype (844.4 nmol/L). A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs70991108 deletion allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~4.6x for heterozygous and homozygous rs70991108 deletion genotypes, respectively (p=0.05). If a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele was also a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).Studies have also looked for connections between this SNP and the risk of having a baby born with spina bifida, but the results are inconsistent between studies:  PMID 14735580, PMID 15755837: suggested the del/del genotype increased risk for spina bifida and pre-term delivery  : suggested that the del/del genotype actually reduced risk for spina bifida  : found no connection whatsoever between the del/del genotype and spina bifida risk</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="869">Association between rs2799573 and psychiatric disorders was shown in a 2013 study by the Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium . In this study, genome-wide SNP data consisting of 1,250,922 autosomal SNPs were analyzed to identify genetic variants associated with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. 33,332 cases and 27,888 controls included both unrelated and family-based samples (trios). A multinomial logistic regression procedure was used to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. This SNP, on chromosome 10 in an intron of CACNB2, was one of four genome-wide significant signals associated with the five psychiatric disorders (p = 4.29 x 10-8). The risk allele T exhibited allele frequency of 0.715 in controls. CACNB2 encodes a voltage-gated calcium-channel subunit that interacts with other calcium-channel subunits to facilitate their function and increase peak calcium current. Although CACNB2 had not been previously identified as a risk gene for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, its interactor CACNA1C, was known to be a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder , schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder . Effects of CACNA1C variants on emotion processing circuitry, attention, and memory were demonstrated in fMRI studies . Consistent with this, one of the four significant signals from the 2013 study lies within an intron of CACNA1C. Other peaks identified in this study were rs2535629 and rs11191454.In addition, a variant within CACNB2 52 kb away from rs2799573 was one of the most significant signals in an independent GWAS of bipolar disorder in Han Chinese. All samples analyzed in the Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium study were of European ancestry.</p>

The klotho protein is a hormone found primarily in the kidney and choroid plexus of the brain. At the genetic level, the Klotho gene is reported to affect longevity in mice  and perhaps humans , and KL-VS heterozygosity (but not homozygosity) has been associated with greater brain cortical volume . At the protein level, older adults with higher plasma klotho concentrations tend to show lower less decline with age on standardized cognitive tests , adults with higher stress tend to have lower plasma klotho levels , and transgenic mice bred to have excess human amyloid precursor protein (to simulate Alzheimer's disease) score better on some tests when their klotho levels are increased .Most of the studies cited above for studies of klotho in humans should be considered preliminary for at least two reasons: they are not based on large sample sizes, and, they haven't been replicated by independent investigators. In addition, there is a report showing no difference in the klotho plasma levels between FC/FC and FC/VS individuals , as well as a report showing KL-VS heterozygotes had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers , in contrast to the studies cited above.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="40">rs4148739 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is unconfirmed. In clinic, even the lower concentrations of drugs may achieve sufficient antidepressant effect, and the dose of the drug can be adjusted upwards until the patient responds. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect in depression and eight that they do not.rs4148739 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele. The list of the 9 SNPs is shown below.When treated for depression with citalopram, paroxetine, amitriptyline, or venlafaxine (substrates of the protein encoded by ABCB1), a highly statistically significant association between the overall genetic variability of these SNPs and the remission was reported by Uhr et al in a study of ~400 German inpatients. However, this result has to be treated with caution. A well-run, double-blind study of ABCB1 substrate citalopram in depression (STAR-D study) and a following meta-analysis  failed to replicate several Uhr et al. results for other ABCB1 SNPs.The 9 SNPs in the linkage block identified are :  rs2235067  rs4148740  rs2032583  rs4148739  rs11983225  rs2235040  rs12720067  rs7787082  rs10248420</p>

Clinical stroke   A study of 8,000 individuals concluded that the Marburg I polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of clinical stroke (HR 1.60, CI: 1.13-2.28) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.33, CI: 1.04-1.71).  Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)   In a relatively small study (300 patients, 200 controls), the Marburg I variant was seen as an independent risk factor for VTE (OR 3.5, CI: 1.2-10.0) and  also idiopathic VTE (OR 6.2, CI: 2.0-18.9).   A larger study of ~900 patients determined that the Marburg I variant was associated with the development of deep venous thrombosis (OR 1.65, CI:1.16-2.34) and recurrent thromboembolic events (OR 2.13, CI; 1.35-3.36) OR (95% CI).   Familial Nonmedullary Thyroid cancer   Carriers of a Marburg I variant have about a 2x higher risk for thyroid cancer based on a study of 400+ patients. Functional studies indicated that the HABP2 protein may normally have a tumor-suppressive effect, but the G534E variant results in a loss of that function.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="825">This SNP, located in an intron of the BTBD9 gene, has a variant that is seen somewhat more frequently in individuals with restless legs syndrome. The risk allele is rs3923809(A); carriers of two such alleles, i.e. those with rs3923809(A;A) genotypes, are estimated to be 1.9 fold more likely to have restless legs syndrome than rs3923809(G;G) individuals. The authors of this study suggest that perhaps half of the cases of restless legs syndrome may involve the rs3923809 risk genotypes. Consistent with this finding, another report about rs3923809 links the (G) minor allele to a lower frequency of restless legs syndrome with an overall odds ratio of 0.57 (CI: 0.48-0.68). Note that 70-80% of all individuals in European populations carry one or two copies of the (A) major allele, yet restless legs syndrome is thought to affect less than 10% of all adults. Therefore, although an individual may be at higher risk based on their genotype, the genotype by itself certainly isn't able to predictably cause restless legs syndrome.The association between rs3923809 and RLS has been replicated in three European populations, and shows the most consistent effect across populations of several SNPs studied.The results of a 2013 study of Korean patients suggest that the role of BTBD9 in the pathogenesis of restless legs syndrome is more universal across populations than previously reported and more efforts should be focused on the role of epistasis in the genetic architecture of restless legs syndrome. A significant association was found for rs3923809 and rs9296249 in BTBD9.   Association of restless legs syndrome variants in Korean patients with restless legs syndrome.</p>

Personality disorder patients carrying the DBH TT genotype exhibited higher neuroticism and novelty seeking scores as compared to individuals with the (C;C) or (C;T) genotype. Analyses on the level of the neuroticism and novelty seeking subscales revealed that the DBH (T;T) genotype was primarily associated with personality features related to impulsiveness and aggressive hostility. Also adult ADHD patients carrying the homozygous (T;T) genotypes displayed by significantly increased neuroticism scores; when both personality disorder and adult ADHD patient were analyzed together, (T;T) carriers also displayed by significantly lower conscientiousness levels.

This SNP showed the most association with obesity in the original work by Dina et al .  The rs1421085 T-to- C single-nucleotide alteration underlies the association between FTO and obesity by disrupting ARID5B-mediated repression of IRX3 and IRX5. This disruption leads to a developmental shift from browning to whitening programs and loss of mitochondrial thermogenesisWithin the FTO gene, many SNPs appear to be co-inherited. The SNP showing the strongest association with body weight (i.e. body mass index, BMI) is not rs1421085, although this SNP is one of co-inherited SNPs in the FTO gene region. For more information, refer to the FTO gene or the most studied of FTO SNPs, rs9930506. However, in one study of 583 extremely obese women with several FTO SNPs, the strongest association was indeed with rs1421085 (p=3.04x10<sup>-10</sup>, OR = 1.75, CI: 1.47-2.08).

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5192">rs13225917 represents a relatively rare SNP tested by the 23andMe v3 chip. Due to its rarity, its effects have not and likely won't be determined through GWAS surveys. In HapMap populations, it's most common among Mexicans and Japanese occurring on the dominant European haplotype, and no homozygous A-allele carriers exist in HapMap, OpenSNP or 1000 Genomes, though this might be due to the overall rarity of the rs13225917(A) allele. The mutation causes an aspartate (D) to asparagine (N) change at position 310 (D310N, p.Asp310Asn) in the Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 26 (TTC26), which might (or might not) result in a damaging missense variant. The protein is IFT complex B protein, also known as DYF13 in nematodes, and it has a proposed function-dependent name of IFT56.TTC26 is thought to play a critical role in ciliogenesis and normal cilia (cellular "hairs") function, as determined by protein similarity, and it is highly conserved between ciliated species studied. In studies on Zebrafish, disabling the gene prevented normal development of photoreceptor sensory and other cilia. The protein is necessary for assembly of full length cilia, although the effect (if any) of rs13225917 on its functioning has not been determined. One publication  speculates that this protein may play a role in Inherited Retinal Degeneration and so screening for TTC26 mutations in human ciliopathy|ciliopathies could be warranted, but to date there is no evidence supporting rs13225917 as a mutation of any consequence. TTC26/DYF13 is an intraflagellar transport protein required for transport of motility-related proteins into flagella. Knockdown of ttc26 disrupts ciliogenesis of the photoreceptor cells and the pronephros in zebrafish. The tetratricopeptide repeat: a structural motif mediating protein-protein interactions.</p>

The frequency of the rs5051(T) allele is also generally higher in African populations compared to Caucasian populations, correlating to the higher incidence of hypertension in African population.rs5051 is also known as "A-6G"; the "A" allele when referred to using this nomenclature is rs5051(T), and the "G" allele is rs5051(C). For more details, see rs699.rs5051(T;T) homozygotes have been reported to be at increased risk for Crohn's disease, as based on one cohort of ~350 Australian patients.

According to these results, the presence of the G allele in the patient associated with the incidence of cGvHD (p=0.002) and patients homozygous to the A allele had an increased risk of relapse (p=0.02). In contrast to HLA-E molecules, which are ligands for inhibitory NK receptors, MICA is ligand for activating NKG2D receptors. Patient who are homozygous for a valine at residue 129 of MICA are at higher risk of chronic GvHD after HLA-matched sibling HCT in comparison to patient who have a methionine at this position. This risk was independent of acute GvHD, suggesting that the residue 129 play a role in alloimmune responses and thus maybe protective against GvHD, (Boukouaci W, et al. 2009). MICA mismatching between patient and donor has a great influence on the clinical outcome because of the fact that MICA is polymorphic with over 84 recognized unique alleles (). According to two studies done to evaluate the role of mismatching MICA genes and risk of acute GvHD, it was shown that MICA mismatching was associated with an increased risk of grades II-IV acute GvHD but not grades III-IV acute GvHD in both HLA matched and mismatched transplant, and that was correlated notably with the GvHD of the GI tract (P=0.05).

In Asian (Japanese) populations, the presence of an rs3087243(G) allele represents a 1.3 fold increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease, and for those with autoimmune thyroid disease, a 1.5 fold increased risk of type-1 diabetes. However, in individuals without autoimmune thyroid disease, no association was seen between this SNP and type-1 diabetes. The authors speculate that earlier studies may have reported associations between this SNP and type-1 diabetes that were actually primarily based on the association with autoimmune thyroid disease.This same SNP, rs3087243, has also been implicated as a (minor) risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A study of 2,000+ European RA patients led to a calculated odds ratio of 1.13 (CI: 1.03 - 1.24) for the rs3087243(G) risk allele. In a study of 395 Spanish patients with lupus, rs3087243(G) allele carriers were calculated to have an odds ratio of 1.71 (CI: 1.18-2.49, p=0.003, p(corr) = 0.006).In a different study involving recipients of liver transplants, although also with Spanish patients, the rs3087243(G) allele was significantly associated with acute rejection (odds ratio 1.49, p(corr)=0.038). Patients who lacked this allele had the lowest risk of acute rejection development.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1440">This is a CYP2C8 SNP. The CYP2C8 3 allele is mapped to both rs10509681 and rs11572080). In a 2009 article titled "Genetically based impairment in CYP2C8- and CYP2C9-dependent NSAID metabolism as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding: is a combination of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics required to improve personalized medicine?" It is claimed that individuals carrying minor alleles of this SNP (usually heterozygotes, since minor homozygotes are rare) may show increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib. In a 2008 article (reviewed in ) titled "Interaction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes modifies the risk for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related acute gastrointestinal bleeding," the study discovered that carriers of CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a GI bleeding event risk OR=1.81 (95% CI=0.95–3.46; P=0.071) and risk increased if carriers drank more than 20g alcohol/day to an OR=1.99 (95% CI=1.06–3.74; P=0.034). As CYP2C8 3 and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium, patients are likely to carry the risk allele to both 8 3 and 9 2, and when they do, The OR (95% CI) for carriers of such a genotype is increased to 1.94 (1.13–3.33), P=0.017.   A 2013 NIH review titled "PharmGKB summary: very important pharmacogene information for cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8" reiterated that "some data suggest that the combined presence of minor risk alleles CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080) and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 is a determinant of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding."

However, it was shown in the same study to no longer be significant once two other SNPs, which cause actual changes in the LOXL1 protein, were identified. More specifically, the risk allele rs2165241(T) was found to be associated with glaucoma only because it effectively predicted (with 90% probability) the actual high-risk haplotype consisting of rs1048661(G) and rs3825942(C), as oriented with respect to their entries in dbSNP. However, a meta-analysis published in 2010 concluded that it's likely that SNPs rs1048661 and rs2165241 are not directly implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma; only the nearby rs3825942 seemed to be the disease-associated SNP.  rs2165241 was significantly associated with XFG and XFS (p=4.13x10e-9 for an additive model, heterozygote odds ratio = 4.42 (CI: 2.3-8.5), homozygote odds ratio = 34.19 (CI: 4.48-261), with the rs2165241 (T) allele being the risk allele, found in 83.1% of cases versus 52.4% in controls, based on a study of 62 Caucasian patients.

SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is unconfirmed. In clinic, even the lower concentrations of drugs may achieve sufficient antidepressant effect, and the dose of the drug can be adjusted upwards until the patient responds. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect in depression and eight - that they do not.A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al.  found that rs2235040(A) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates were more likely to remit. However, this result failed to reproduce in a large (900 outpatient subjects) and better designed double-blind study of a well-researched ABCB1 substrate citalopram in depression (STAR-D study).

(The assumption of equivalence between these names is based on the results of searching for rs705381 in the  Variant Name Mapper.) In a study of 101 mostly Caucasian patients prescribed the atypical antipsychotic risperidone, carriers of a rs705381(C) allele were less likely to gain significant weight compared to rs705381(T;T) carriers, as assessed by physiogenomic analysis of corresponding weight profiles. Two other SNPs, rs8179183 and rs6837793, were also significantly associated with weight profiles in these patients. In a study of 461 participants in the HERITAGE cohort (172 African-American, 289 Caucasian), the combination of rs705381 with "PON-126" (RS ID unknown) were found to significantly contribute to trait-anxiety scores.  The authors also cite another paper, , which found that this SNP accounts for 2.4% of the variation in PON1 expression.  Which allele correlates  with increased trait-anxiety scores and/or reduced PON1 expression is unclear.HapMap frequencies for this SNP seem dubious.  They list rs705381(T;T) as being at or near 100% for the population groups reported by SNPedia.  However, the raw data at HapMap for this SNP are largely no-call (e.g. CEU: NN=87, TT=82, CT=3).  The other diversity studies listed at  dbSNP show C as the more common allele (e.g. AFD_AFR_PANEL: CC=47.8%, CT=39.1%, TT=13.0%).  Anecdotal data submitted by participants at 23andme also show C as being more common (CC=4, CT=1, TT=2).  The diversity data have therefore been removed until these discrepancies can be resolved.

For multiple reasons discussed below, interpretation of the impact of this SNP is highly problematic.In addition to the reporting discrepancies between two different DTC labs (AncestryDNA and 23andMe) discussed below, the ClinVar record is decidedly mixed about whether this is, or is not, a pathogenic mutation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. After initially being classified of uncertain significance in 2011 by LabCorp, it was classified as benign in 2013 by both an NIH lab and by GeneDx, but in 2014, GeneDx re-classified it as pathogenic. Furthermore, in a dissertation published in July 2015 for a Masters in Genetic Counseling , rs11570112 was discussed in depth as a variant with conflicting interpretation between ClinVar and labs in the SHaRe academic consortium specializing in cardiomyopathy diagnosis /, citing one group as saying it was benign and the other of uncertain significance.AncestryDNA seems to report the common genotype for this SNP on OpenSNP as C,C on the plus strand, which shows up as G,G on the minus strand in Promethease.  23andme seems to report the common genotype for this SNP as GG on the plus strand, which shows up as C,C on the minus strand on Promethease.  This is an ambiguous flip (C/G).  Th first 10 or so C,C checked on OpenSNP were all AncestyDNA reports, and given the extremely low frequency of the pathogenic allele, this is most likely an ambiguous flip problem.  AncestryDNA users with a homozygous "pathogenic" GG reported by Promethease seem more likely to be wild type.  Additionally, both C,C and G,G are far more common on OpenSNP than C,G, which deviates from Hardy-Weinberg.

G6PD codes for the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which helps protect the cell from oxidative damage.  Depending on genotype, an individual may possess one of two primary versions of the G6PD gene; type A and type B. Type A is predominantly found in people who have African ancestry.  Mutations of G6PD can cause varying degrees of G6PD deficiency, which is a disease affecting red blood cells.  For example, an A to G substitution mutation at the rs1050829 locus (also known as A376G) is associated with reduced production of G6PD enzyme. Other mutations causing G6PD deficiency include; rs1050828. The G6PD deficient genotype A- (~8-20% reduction of G6PD) is typically defined by the possession of both the rs1050829 G allele and the rs1050828 A allele. G6PD deficiency frequency is highest in malarial regions where G6PD deficient individuals are typically less affected by malarial infection ().The minor allele of this SNP should be reclassified as benign according to  Study of malaria in Gambian children uses the rs1050829 allele to help detect G6PD deficient individuals.

This increase is suggested to be followed by the inflammatory cells apoptosis and resolution of the inflammation.  The amount of GLCCI1 protein induced by glucocorticoids was significantly lower in the bronchial epithelial cells of rs37973(G;G) patients as compared to wild type homozygotes possibly resulting in inferior response..Based on 4 populations totaling 900+ asthma patients, the rs37973(G) allele was associated (p = 0.0007, pooled data) with less improvement of lung function in response to inhaled glucocorticoids such as budesonide. The mean (&#177;SE) increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in treated rs37973(G;G) patients was about one third of that seen in rs37973(A;A) patients (3.2&#177;1.6% vs. 9.4&#177;1.1%). Based on dividing the response into highest vs lowest quartiles of response, the allelic odds ratio of falling into the lowest responding quartile based on an additive genetic model was calculated to be 1.52 (CI: 1.13 - 2.03). Genotype accounted for about 7% of overall inhaled glucocorticoid response variability.This result failed to replicate in an analysis of corticosteroid clinical trials in a population of 1,900 non-Hispanic white patients with asthma. rs37973 did not influence change from baseline in forced expiratory volume. There was only a non-significant trend toward less response in rs37973(G;G) patients.In a study of 400 Japanese patients with bronchial asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroids, the pulmonary function was not significantly different in rs37973(G;G) compared with rs37973(A;A) genotypes.

Based on studies totaling ~4,000 individuals of Caucasian ancestry, homozygotes for one allele have shorter QT intervals, while homozygotes for the other allele have a longer QT interval. A follow-up study determined that one rs10494366(G) allele was associated with a 3.8-ms (CI: 3.0 - 4.6ms, p=7.8x10(-20)) increase in QT interval duration, and two (G) alleles had twice that increase. No increase in risk for sudden death due to a cardiac problem was associated with this SNP, though.  rs10494366 minor homozygotes had a 9.3 msec longer QT interval compared to major homozygotes (p=5.7x10(-5)); rs10918594 minor homozygotes had a 12.5 msec longer QT interval compared to major homozygotes (p=1.5x10(-6)). Restricting analyses to the diabetic EAs strengthened the effect despite the reduction in sample size (11.3 msec difference, p=5.1x10(-5); 13.9 msec difference, p=1.6x10(-6), respectively).

This SNP affects the structure, activity, and substrate specificity of the BuChE (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme. Cholinesterases and cholinesterase inhibitors, p. 48 The variant form, rs1799807(G), replaces aspartate with glycine at the secondary substrate/inhibitor binding site.  This single base substitution yields the "atypical" version of BChE.  This version has a lower affinity for many substrates, including many Cholinesterase Inhibitors (CIs).  A different cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) is an important component of neurotransmission by acetylcholine (ACh), terminating the action of ACh after it has been released during neurotransmission. BChE is found widely in the plasma and normally binds to CIs, protecting AChE from being inhibited by CIs and so maintaining normal neurotransmission by acetylcholine.Practical consequences of altered substrate affinity from this SNP include:  Succinylcholine, commonly used as an anesthetic, depends on BChE hydrolysis for recovery.  rs1799807(G;G) homozygotes experience a much delayed return to spontaneous breathing following its use.    "Atypical" BChE has a low affinity for CI alkaloids naturally occuring in certain plants, particularly those in the nightshade family (potato, tomato, peppers, eggplant, etc.).  rs1799807(G) carriers may be more prone to physiological consequences of AChE inhibition from eating these foods.  Many pesticides are CIs, including organophosphates and carbamates.  rs1799807(G) carriers may have atypical reactions to pesticide residues on foods and in the environment.  Many nerve agents, such as Sarin and VX gas, as well agents used to protect soldiers against them, such as pyridostigmine, are CIs.  rs1799807(G) carriers may be more susceptible to exposure to these agents.  "Atypical" BuChE, rs1799807(G), has 30% lower enzymatic activity than the wild-type enzyme.  Homoygous carriers of this polymorphism, rs1799807(G;G), display extreme anxiety after exposure to CIs.

More specifically, the rs3736228(T) allele was associated with reduced lumbar spine BMD (p = 2.6 x 10<sup>-9</sup>), and femoral neck BMD (p = 5.0 x 10<sup>-6</sup>).Note that rs4988321, another LRP5 SNP (also known as Val667Met), was independently associated with BMD in this same study. news rs3736228 was associated with a 30% increase in the risk of both osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. Both increases were significant, at P=0.002 and P=0.008, respectively.  rs3736228 associated with decreased bone mineral density (p=6.3x10(-12) for lumbar spine and p=1.9x10(-4) for femoral neck) and an increased risk of both osteoporotic fractures (odds ratio OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.09-1.52, p=0.002) and osteoporosis (OR 1.3, 1.08-1.63, p=0.008). rs4355801 associated with decreased bone mineral density (p=7.6x10(-10) for lumbar spine and p=3.3x10(-8) for femoral neck) and increased risk of osteoporosis (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01-1.42, p=0.038). The presence of both risk alleles increased the risk of osteoporotic fractures (OR 1.3, 1.08-1.63, p=0.006) and this effect was independent of bone mineral density.A later study (2009) also found an association between rs3736228 and hip BMD; subjects with rs3736228(T;T) genotypes had 8.4% higher total-hip BMD compared to other genotypes (p = 0.009) at baseline in a study of 249 osteoporotic Caucasian men.</p>

There are several entries in dbSNP covering this same position; the one here in SNPedia is the one with population frequency. The most common allele has a run of 5 G's in the area around this SNP, and in the literature the allele is commonly called the 5G allele. A deletion of one nucleotide leads to the "4G" allele, i.e. rs1799889(-).The 4G allele has been reported to increase risk for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease ; on the other hand, the 5G allele may increase the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). In combination with the A2 allele of the ITGB3 gene, rs5918, the increased risk of myocardial infarction in a Finnish study population was 4 fold higher (odds ratio = 4.5, p=0.001), particularly in males (odds ratio = 6.4, p=0.0005) .

SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and newer antidepressant drugs ,. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is to be confirmed. A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2032583(C) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates had better chances on remission. However,could not be reproduced in a large (~900) -trial with outpatient with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , the significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome among all studies with this SNP becomes insignificant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. However, the association remained significant after Bonferroni-correction in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients.rs2032583 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele.

Having one copy (i.e. being a rs1051730(C;T) genotype) increased risk for lung cancer about 1.3x, and having two copies (rs1051730(T;T) individuals) represented 1.8x increased risk. Up to 14% of lung cancer incidence may be attributable to this allele.PMID 18385738, PMID 18385676An independent study published at the same time concluded that (T) allele carriers for SNP rs1051730 are not at higher risk of becoming smokers compared to (C) carriers. However, if they do smoke, (T) carriers are quite likely to smoke more cigarettes than (C) carriers, and as an apparent consequence, they are at higher risk for lung cancer as reported in this and other studies. This study therefore links rs1051730 directly to nicotine dependence, and indirectly to lung cancer. According to DeCODE, the CC genotype at rs1051730 is associated with 0.88x risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Note: publications tend to refer to the risk allele as "A", however, the orientation reported for rs1051730 in dbSNP is for the opposite strand, so in keeping with reporting all SNPs in the orientation published in dbSNP, SNPedia refers to this same risk allele as the (T) allele. / 23andMe blog (T;T) once more smoke per day. rs1051730 influences how much alcohol it takes to have you feel a buzz.

This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1 28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1839">rs6427196 is located in the F5/NME7 region on chromosome 1q24.2 at position 167747847.  This SNP is in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of F5.  F5, also known as coagulation factor V (proaccelerin, lavile factor), encodes an essential cofactor of the blood coagulation cascade and defects in this gene have been known to result in either an autosomal recessive hemorrhagic diathesis or an autosomal dominant form of thrombophilia.  Recently, this SNP has been found to be associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE).  VTE, which can manifest itself as either deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common cardiovascular condition with a high mortality rate .  Annually, ~2 million adults develop DVT and approximately 600,000 PE hospitalizations and 60,000 deaths occur .  In a study done by Tang et al., a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted by first analyzing the top SNP associations for total incident VTE in CHARGE (cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology) and then the second-stage studies were performed using data from three case-control studies: the Mayo Clinic VTE Study, the MARseille Thrombosis Association VTE Study, and a French case-control study on early-onset VT.  In the CHARGE GWAS, 1,618 VTE cases were included from 44,499 participants, all of which were of European origin.  From that, the top 1,047 SNPs identified as having the greatest association were analyzed in 3,231 VTE cases and 3,536 controls.The initial CHARGE GWAS revealed that the rs6427196 G minor allele had a risk ratio (RR) of 1.82 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.58 to 2.10.  The p-value of this association was 1.97 x 10-16.  The second-stage analysis gave a RR of 2.31 with a 95% CI of 2.04 to 2.62 and a p-value of 2.56 x 10-38.  At this point, all the studies were combined to give an overall RR and p-value which indicated rs6427196 as the highest associated SNP with VTE.  The overall RR was 2.07 (95% CI = 1.89 &#8211; 2.28) and a p-value of 4.47 x 10-51.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="34">rs2235015 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein (P-glycoprotein - Pgp) that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors PMID 28648553 and newer antidepressant drugs ,.  However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is still to be confirmed. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect on depression outcome and eight - that they do not. However those 18 studies are difficult to compare because they vary within their study design concerning following factors: population (ethnicity, psychiatric condition), tested SNPs, tested antidepressants (Pgp substrates and Pgp non-substrates) and doses, inclusion of drug metabolism monitoring and statistical correction for multiple testing.A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2235015(T) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates were more likely to remit. However, this result could not be reproduced in a large (N~900) trial with outpatients with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , no significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome with this SNP among all studies, but the association remained significant in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients. rs2235015 is near the 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="249">rs2494732 is a SNP in the AKT1 gene, encoding one of three serine/threonine-protein kinases regulating numerous processes such as cell survival, growth and angiogenesis. Medical conditions that may be linked to the rarer (minor) rs2494732(C) allele include drug response, schizophrenia, and drug-related psychoses, in particular, cannabis-related psychosis.  A study of 442 healthy, once-a-month cannabis users between the ages of 16-23 to see if AKT1 variants influenced acute psychosis response concluded that the number of rs2494732(C) alleles predicted (p = 0.015) acute (i.e. temporary) psychotic response to cannabis. Basically, the more copies someone had of this SNP, the more likely they were to have mind-altering symptoms while stoned. Other factors studied, including gender, ethnicity, and years of cannabis use, did not predict whether they would have these (transient) symptoms. Note that this side-effect (psychosis or paranoia) was infrequent in an absolute sense regardless of genotype. A case-control study of 489 first-episode psychosis patients concluded that while rs2494732 was not associated with an increased risk of a psychotic disorder, with lifetime cannabis use, or with frequency of use, there was a significant association between psychosis and cannabis use. rs2494732(C;C) individuals with a history of cannabis use had an increased likelihood of a psychotic disorder (odds ratio 2.18, CI: 1.1 - 4.3) when compared with users who were (T;T) carriers. The interaction between the rs2494732 genotype and frequency of use was also somewhat significant (likelihood ratio = 13.39; p = .010). Among daily users, (C;C) carriers had a 7x increase in the odds of psychosis compared with (T;T) carriers (odds ratio 7.23, CI: 1.37 - 38.12). among (likely Japanese) 120 first-episode neuroleptic-naive schizophrenics treated with risperidone genotyped for 30 variants in misc. dopamine and serotonin (receptors and otherwise) two SNPs in DRD2 (rs1799989 and rs1800497) and two SNPs in AKT1 (rs3803300 and rs2494732) were significant predictors of treatment response to risperidoneThe ancestral allele is C in the  dbSNP database.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="214">This is a good proxy for alpha-2B-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2B) deletion polymorphism (del301–303; rs4066772). The minor rs2229169 allele was in a strict linkage disequilibrium with the deletion of three amino acids in ADRA2B (Ins/Del301-303) in a mixed African–American/white group  and in a large Chinese study .Alpha-2B adrenergic receptors contribute to norepinephrine stimulation in the brain and to peripheral vasoconstriction. The deletion polymorphism del301–303 encodes a version of the receptor that, unlike normal alpha-2B receptors, fails to decrease its activity (desensitize) in response to prolonged stimulation . This may result in both negative cardiovascular consequences and positive cognitive effects.A large population cohort of Finnish middle-aged men (1606 men, mean age at the start 53 years) was followed for the average time of 18 years. Acute coronary events defined as hospitalizations for myocardial infarction or prolonged acute chest pain were more frequent in the men with del301–303 polymorphism: Del/Del OR=1.57 (P=0.002), Del/Ins OR=1.25 (P=0.077), Ins/Ins OR=1. Associations with the number of sudden cardiac deaths and overall cardiac heart disease mortality were also observed, but they would not be significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. A study of Koreans compared more than 600 patients hospitalized for an ischemic stroke with control subjects. The deletion polymorphism conferred higher risk of ischemic stroke: Del/Del OR=1.78 (P=0.007), Del/Ins OR=1.25 (P=0.107), Ins/Ins OR=1. Association of the deletion genotype with small-vessel disease was the main contributor to the risk. In a study of more than 400 young Swiss adults, the carriers of del301–303 polymorphism had about 20% better memory for emotional photographs, both positive and negative. This enhancement of emotional memory was selective: the level of emotions caused by the photographs, the memory for neutral photographs, working memory, and attention were not dependent on genotype. Among the Rwandan genocide refugees, the same authors found the deletion to be associated with increased re-experiencing of traumatic events but independently from PTSD, which was distributed equally among the genotypes. Homozygous rs2229169 Chinese subjects, being by extension del301–303 homozygotes, also had about 20% better (shorter) reaction time in a stop-go cognitive test as compared to wild-type homozygotes.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3414">Icelanders with two copies of the rare T allele at SNP in the MYH6 gene, also known as c.2161, have an increased risk of sick sinus syndrome (SSS), also known as sinus node dysfunction. No rs# has yet been assigned to this location. SSS is a group of disorders that affect heart rhythm.MYH6 c.2161C>T was discovered in a GWAS published in March 2011 .  The discovery phase included 792 Icelandic cases with 37,592 Icelandic controls.  The SNPs with the strongest associations with SSS were rs2231801, rs28730774 and 14-22399934.  Since rs28730774 was the most significant SNP on the HumanOmni1-Quad chip (p = 1.6E-11; OR = 3.49; minor allele frequency = 0.01), it was studied further. In the second phase of the study, 7 chip-typed Icelandic cases (4 with the rs28730774 SNP) and 80 chip-typed Icelandic controls were subjected to whole genome sequencing.  In this analysis, the MYH6 c.2161C>T variant had the strongest association with SSS.  The mutation is located in exon 18 of the MYH6 gene and leads to an arginine to tryptophan amino acid alteration at amino acid 721.       In a follow-up validation study, the odds-ratio was calculated as OR = 12.95 with a p-value = 3.8E-5.  No homozygotes were identified.  Additionally, 184 Danish, 94 Dutch and 1498 US controls were compared to 135 US SSS cases, and no carriers of MYH6 c.2161C>T were found. The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome was reported to be around 6% for non-carriers of c.2161C>T but approximately 50% for carriers of this (c.2161C>T) variant.  alpha-MyHC is also associated with a 4.16-beat per minute decrease in heart rate (p=0.0019).The minor allele (T) results in a missense mutation in the ''MYH6'' gene, encoding the alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MyHC) protein.  This protein is a fast ATPase present mainly in atrial tissue.  The p.Arg721Trp variant resides in part of the converter domain of alpha-MyHC and is important for amplifying structural rearrangements of myosin during contraction.  This variant has been predicted to result in structural alterations .       As of May 2011, no frequency data are available.</p>

Generally, the B2 allele is considered to lead to higher HDL levels.However, high HDL cholesterol, at least when combined with another HDL raising SNP (rs1800588), doesn't appear to actually protect individuals from coronary artery disease, at least based on one study of ~800 Caucasian male patients. A similarly confusing picture emerges from a study of two populations of 10,000+ individuals each. The distribution of the CETP genotype was observed to be different in population-based studies compared with studies in populations selected by high cardiovascular risk, and contradictory results were seen when trying to figure out if the TaqIB SNP predicted whether drugs would lower plasma lipids or cardiovascular outcome.A meta-analysis concluded that there probably was a statistically significant, but weak, association for this SNP. For each rs708272(T) allele inherited, individuals had lower mean CETP mass (-9.7%; CI: -11.7% to -7.8%), lower mean CETP activity (-8.6%; CI: -13.0% to -4.1%), higher mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (4.5%; CI: 3.8%-5.2%), and higher mean apolipoprotein A-I concentrations (2.4%; CI, 1.6%-3.2%). The combined per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for coronary disease were 0.95 (CI: 0.92-0.99).A prospective cohort study of 18,245 initially healthy American women over a 10-year period found similar results with respect to HDL-C levels and (inversely) risk of myocardial infarction; rs708272(T) was associated with a per-allele increase in HDL-C levels of 3.1 mg/dL and a concordant 24 percent lower risk of future myocardial infarction (age-adjusted HR 0.76, CI: 0.62-0.94).rs708272 has also been associated with reduced coronary heart disease risk in those drinking alcohol.

Amino acid predictions from genome sequence may predict this as L483P or Leu483Pro; this disparity in position calling may be due to a 39 peptide signal sequence. Polyphen 2 predicts  P04062 L483P to be "possibly damaging" with a score of 0.857 (sensitivity: 0.83; specificity: 0.93). ( P04062 is the uniprot ID for GBA.)The risk allele (in current dbSNP orientation) is (G), and as the inheritance is autosomal recessive, individuals must either be compound heterozygotes (for two different GBA mutations) or rs421016(G;G) homozygotes to develop Gaucher disease. There are over 300 mutations now known to occur in the GBA gene, with many associated with increasing risk for either type I, II, or III Gaucher disease.This SNP (along with others associated with Gaucher disease) is studied extensively in Ashkenazi Jewish populations where it is found in relatively high frequency.Note: this SNP used to have a "mirror" SNP, rs35095275, representing the opposite strand yet the same exact nucleotide position; it has now been merged into this SNP.One copy of rs421016(G) has also been shown to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease ~5 fold across multiple ethnicities, and to lower a bit the age of onset of Parkinson's. In one study, the estimated age-specific risk for Parkinson's disease at 60 and 80 years of age was 4.7% and 9.1% among Gaucher disease patients, i.e. those carrying two Gaucher GBA mutations, compared with 1.5% and 7.7% among GBA mutation heterozygotes, and 0.7% and 2.1% for carriers of zero Gaucher GBA mutations, respectively.

Risk for drug dependence (and drug abuse was associated with rs324420(A;A) homozygotes. In a study of 40 daily marijuana users who abstained for 24 h and were then presented with a cue-elicited craving paradigm, followed by smoking a marijuana cigarette, rs324420(A) was significantly associated with changes in withdrawal after abstinence and with happiness after smoking marijuana, but was not associated with changes in heart rate after smoking or with changes in craving or other acute effects.This variant has also been associated with pain insensitivity. In a 2016 study, ~1000 women undergoing surgery for breast cancer were tested for cold and heat pain sensitivity; rs324420(A;A) individuals reported significantly lower cold pain sensitivity and less need for postoperative analgesia. The rs324420(A;C) genotype was also seen in a woman with unusually high pain tolerance, along with a ~8kb heterozygous microdeletion of the adjacent FAAH pseudogene.And from a different perspective, a 2016 study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies found "a strong correlation between a nation's happiness and the presence of the (rs324420) A allele in the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) gene".

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2172">rs17026688 is a SNP located in an intron of the glutamate decarboxylase-like 1 GADL1 gene. It is linked to rs17026651, and both are 100% linked to a 1 base deletion known as 'GADL1 IVS8+48delG' (rs201973599).In a study of ~1,700 patients of Han Chinese descent with bipolar disorder, researchers discovered that almost all of the patients who responded well to lithium treatment had at least one IVS8+48delG GADL1 allele. Initially, the researchers were focused on two nearby SNPs, rs17026688 and rs17026651, that turned out to be proxies (due to being in high linkage disequilibrium) for the deletion variant. rs17026688(T) is the "response allele", meaning that at least in these Asian patients, bipolar patients who are carriers of at least one (T) allele are predicted to respond well to lithium treatment; rs17026688(C;C) patients are predicted to respond poorly.The odds ratios and probabilities for this study are so high that the authors are able to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV; NPV) for the connection between this DNA variant and being a bipolar patient who will respond well (or not) to lithium treatment. In a pooled cohort of ~400 patients, roughly divided equally between those responding well to lithium or not, the odds ratios, p values, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were around 80, 1 x 10e-50, 93%, 87%, 83% and 95%, respectively. To put it another way, while overall about half of all patients had a response allele and half didn't, only 1 in 14 patients who responded well to lithium lacked a response allele, and only 1 in 8 of those who did not respond well had a response allele. The authors naturally suggest the use of these SNPs as useful biomarkers for which patients with bipolar disorder will respond well to lithium treatment, and they also intend to (1) look for additional GADL1 gene variants acting similarly, especially in non-Asian populations given the rarity of this particular deletion variant outside of Asian population, and (2) see if these variants influence lithium treatment outcomes in other affective disorders such as major depressive disorder.</p>

This protein, found primarily in the liver, regulates the uptake of numerous drugs and natural compounds. The rs4149056(C) SNP defines the SLCO1B1 5 allele.The rs4149056(C) allele gives rise to an amino acid change (from valine to alanine at residue 174) which has reduced uptake/transport activity. Therefore, drugs metabolized by OATP1B1 tend to build up to higher circulating concentrations than they would otherwise..The drugs known (or in some cases, thought) to be transported less well by the variant OATP1B1 protein encoded by the rs4149056(C) allele include: Several cholesterol lowering statins, generally leading to reduced inhibitory effects on liver cholesterol synthesis and possibly worse side effects, by such drugs as:  simvastatin  pravastatin  rosuvastatin  pitavastatin fexofenadine repaglinide methotrexate the SN-38 active metabolite of irinotecan rifampicin caspofungin lopinavir rs4363657 in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium with rs4149056 SNP (r<sup>2</sup>=0.97), which has been linked to statin metabolism. rs4149056(C) odds ratio for myopathy among 20,000 individuals taking either 40 or 80mg of simvastatin daily was 4.5 (CI: 2.6-7.7) per copy of the C allele, and 16.9 (CI: 4.7-61.1) in (C;C) as compared with (T;T) homozygotes.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3256">rs2333227 is a SNP in the promoter region of the myeloperoxidase MPO gene; it is also known as the -463 variant. It has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and lupus nephritis in SLE patients.In connection with Alzheimer's disease (AD):  A study of 127 Finnish patients concluded that the rs2333227(T) allele increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease by 3.8 fold. This was derived by noting that a man with an ApoE allele has an AD odds ratio of 3.0 if they don't also have an rs2333227(T) allele, and an odds ratio of 11.4 if they do.  A study of 148 Italian sporadic AD patients yielded an odds ratio for the rs2333227(C;C) genotype (as oriented in dbSNP orientation) of 1.78 (CI: 1.13-2.80). The presence of rs669(G;G), in addition to rs2333227(C;C), appears to  synergistically increase the risk of AD to an odds ratio of 25.5 (CI: 4.65-139.75), regardless of ApoE status.In connection with lung cancer:  A pooled analysis of data from 10 studies (3688 cases) found an odds ratio for lung cancer of 0.88 (CI: 0.80-0.97) for rs2333227(C;T) heterozygotes, and 0.71 (CI: 0.57-0.88) for (T;T) homozygotes. This protective effect applied to both men and women, and appeared to apply to "ever" smokers but not "never" smokers.In connection with lupus nephritis:  While there was no association with lupus (SLE) per se in this study of 200+ African-American patients, the risk of developing lupus nephritis among SLE patients was significantly higher among rs2333227(C;T) heterozygotes compared with (C;C) homozygotes (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.12-3.97), and it was even higher for (T;T) homozygotes versus (C;C) (odds ratio 3.52, CI: 1.41-8.77).In connection with gastric cancer:  rs2333227(T) carriers are at increased risk for gastric cancer, based on a study of 157 Taiwanese patients. If they are also H. pylori-infected, they have a 7.9x increased risk of gastric cancer, either intestinal or diffuse types.</p>

The protein encoded by this gene is the target for drugs designed to inhibit its action, in order to lower cholesterol levels. SNPs in the HMGCR gene may affect how well such drugs (typically statins) work.In a study of ~1,500 patients treated with 40mg/d of pravastatin, rs17238540(G;T) heterozgyotes had a mean decrease in total cholesterol of 32.5 mg/dL (0.85 mmol/L), while the mean change for rs17238540(T;T) homozygotes was 41.8 mg/dL (1.09 mmol/L), a reduction in overall efficacy of 22.3% (absolute difference, 9.3 mg/dL, CI: 3.8-14.7 mg/dL, p<.001). The drop in total cholesterol was almost completely due to the decrease in LDL cholesterol, as there was no significant difference in the change in HDL cholesterol with pravastatin between genotypes.A separate study of 1,000 Scottish individuals taking statins found that 28% of rs17238540(T;T) individuals failed to reach target compared with 51% of the individuals carrying a (G) allele, yielding an adjusted odds ratio for failure of 2.93 (CI: 1.61-5.34) mmol/l, p=0.0005. Additionally, they found that heterozygotes had a 13% smaller reduction in total cholesterol (-32.3 vs. -37.1%, p=0.0081) and a 27% smaller reduction in triglycerides (-27.5 vs. -37.6%, p=0.0046), leading to their conclusion that rs17238540(G;T) heterozygotes may respond less well to statin therapy in terms of lowered total cholesterol and triglycerides. This SNP is in tight linkage (r<sup>2</sup>>0.90) with another, rs17244841, so practically speaking, they are equivalent to each other.

Allograft complications   A study of 300+ recipients of hematopoietic-cell transplants concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for a recipient of developing a life-threatening invasive aspergillosis infection was 6.16x higher (CI: 1.97-19.26, p=0.002) if the donor carried these TLR4 risk alleles. This risk was statistically significant for unrelated recipients of transplants (odds ratio, 5.0, CI: 1.04-24.01, p=0.04) but did not quite meet the p=0.05 significance criteria for related recipients (odds ratio, 2.29, CI: 0.93-5.68, p=0.07).</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="216">Also known as Arg389, variation at this SNP, located in the ADRB1 gene, may encode either the amino acid glycine or arginine at amino acid position 389 of the corresponding protein, the beta-1 adrenergic receptor (hence why it is frequently called Arg389Gly). This protein is the target of beta blocker drugs, and so how well the drug works to help lower a patients high blood pressure depends in part on this SNP. The status of this SNP is often reported together with the status of SNP rs1801252, which encodes an amino acid variant at position 49 of the same (ADRB1) protein. The rs1801253(G) allele encodes the glycine.One of the best known studies of the effects of these 2 separate SNPs on the average efficacy of the beta blocker metoprolol in lowering blood pressure (BP) can be summarized for patients with the corresponding genotypes as follows : rs1801252(A;A) and rs1801253(C;C) carriers: 15 point drop in BP rs1801252(A;G) and rs1801253(C;C) carriers:  9 point drop in BP rs1801252(A;A) and rs1801253(C;G) carriers:  6 point drop in BP rs1801252(A;G) and rs1801253(C;G) carriers: <1 point drop in BPThis SNP may also determine whether the drug bucindolol will have any effect on a particular patient.In a separate study of 600+ women initially referred for coronary angiography and then followed for 6 years, during which time 115 experienced a heart problem, rs1801253(G;G) individuals were calculated to be at higher risk (adjusted hazard ratio 3.63, CI: 1.17&#226;&#8364;&#8220;11.28). This risk was specifically for myocardial infarction, and was only seen in women without obstructive coronary artery disease.Other press releases or articles include:  Alters response to heart failure drugs bisoprolol, metoprolol, and carvedilol   This  press release provides a helpful summary of the PMID 16844790| research paper.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2371">rs5443, a SNP in the G-protein beta3 subunit (GNB3) gene that is more commonly known as the C825T variant, has been linked to a number of metabolic conditions including obesity, coronary artery disease, insulin resistance and therefore diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertension. It has also been linked to how well a patient responds to Viagra (sildenafil). Several studies have been unable to replicate one or more of the associations in at least some populations between this SNP and these conditions. The more notable studies include: rs5443(T) allele carriers are 2-3 fold more likely to be obese in Caucasian, Chinese, and African American populations.  rs5443(T) carriers are clearly at higher risk for hypertension, but this review indicates that whether they are also at increased risk for stroke and left ventricular hypertrophy remains controversial.  rs5443(T;T) women gain significantly more weight during pregnancy than rs5443(C;T) or rs5443(C;C) women, and had a significantly higher pre-pregnancy body mass index.   rs5443(T;T) genotypes respond to Viagra better. 91% of them have a "positive erectile response" upon taking Viagra, whereas only around 50% of rs5443(C;T) and rs5443(C;C) individuals respond equivalently to the drug. The odds ratio for the positive response was 10.0 (CI: 1.2 - 81.1, p = 0.01).   rs5443(T;T) patients receiving clozapine over a long term for the treatment of schizophrenia gain significantly more weight (16%) compared to patients carrying at least one rs5443(C) allele in a study of Chinese patients.  rs5443(T) carriers taking triptans for the treatment of migraines or cluster headaches were ~3 fold more likely to respond positively compared with rs5443(C;C) homozygotes (OR 2.96, CI:1.34 - 6.56, p=0.0074) in a study of ~200 Caucasian patients.  rs5443(C;T) genotypes are more prevalent in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients relative to healthy controls (odds ratio 1.43, CI: 1.04&#8211;1.98). rs5443(C;C) individuals do not lose weight under sibutramine therapy whereas (C;T) and (T;T) individuals do, based on a study of 131 obese Taiwanese patients. / 23andMe blog</p>

Among other studies, it has been confirmed in a meta-analysis of 8 studies totaling 7,381 patients and over 10,000 controls from both European and Asian populations.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (T); the odds ratio associated the presence of a risk allele was 1.3 for rheumatoid arthritis and 1.55 for lupus (SLE). The paper states that, "Homozygosity of the risk allele, as compared with absence of the allele, was associated with a more than doubled risk for lupus and a 60% increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis."

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2435">This SNP, in the GSTP1 gene influences asthma risk; the (A) allele encodes the Ile, while the (G) allele encodes the Val. This SNP is also known as GSTP1Val105, or GSTP1 Ile105Val.Despite evidence of antioxidant effects of vitamin E in vitro and in animal studies, large, randomized clinical trials have not substantiated a benefit of vitamin E in reducing inflammation in humans. In healthy control subjects, the effect of &#945;-tocopherol supplementation on the production of inflammatory cytokines appears to be dependent on an individual's genotype. These genotype-specific differences may help explain some of the discordant results in studies that used vitamin E. Persons having the alleles AA or AG had an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon supplementing alpha-tocopherol (the most common form of Vitamin E in a North American diet) while those with GG saw a decrease. This  research paper shows that 13- to 21-year-olds exposed to tobacco smoke at home, with this mutation had more severe asthma than those without the mutation. rs1695 is also mentioned in this  bbc articleSeveral papers published findings associating GSTP1 Ile105Val genotypes with bronchial, childhood, or atopic asthma. Note that some studies, however, have not observed any association between this SNP and asthma in certain populations , or even more paradoxically, have observed that rs1695(G;G) homozygotes appear to be somewhat protected (OR 0.29) from developing asthma compared to individuals with rs1695(A;G) or (A;A) genotypes. A cohort of 1,610 children in the US were studied to determine that the risk for new-onset asthma was highest in rs1695(A;A) homozygotes who participated in 3 or more sports in high-ozone communities. These children were at 6x higher risk (CI: 2.2-7.4). A study of 3,000 Chinese women with breast cancer concluded that rs1695(G;G) genotype was significantly associated with greater breast cancer risk, particularly in premenopausal women (odds ratio 1.69, CI: 1.17-2.43). The odds increased further if such women reported eating little cruciferous vegetables (then the odds ratio was 2.08, CI: 1.20-3.59).A relatively small study of 58 patients with different types of cancer receiving docetaxel concluded that rs1695(A;A) homozygotes (i.e. Ile105/Ile105 homozygotes) had a higher risk of developing docetaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (DIPN), particularly grade 2 or higher.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1472">Also known as c.100C>T (p.Pro34Ser or P34S), the wild type (normal) allele at this SNP is (C). The (T) variant indicates the presence of a non-wild type CYP2D6 variant, but it appears in many different variants so it can not be used to determine the presence of any particular variant. The most common variants it appears in are CYP2D6 10 and CYP2D6 4, but these are not the only ones. While this is the defining mutation for CYP2D6 10, it is not possible by itself for this mutation to determine a particular variant. In addition, the CYP2D6 4 variant includes this mutation, but the defining mutation 1846G>A SNP is not available in the common direct to consumer testing services.While it is not possible for this mutation to identify one particular variant, all the variants in which it appears have reduced or no CYP2D6 activity.If two copies of this (or similar) changes are inherited, poor metabolism ('PM') of debrisoquine  is observed. Other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 include dextromorphan, sparteine, nortriptyline, atomoxetine , and codeine.Nakamura et al  suggest that thermal instabilities and reduced intrinsic clearance by the protein encoded by the rs1065852(T) allele are the main reasons Asians show lower metabolic activities than Caucasians for drugs metabolized mainly by CYP2D6, since this (T) allele occurs in higher frequency in Asians.A study of several hundred Chinese breast cancer patients treated with either tamoxifen or toremifene reported that for the 50 women who were CYP2D6 10 homozygotes (i.e. rs1065852(T;T)), the group treated with toremifene had a significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate than the group treated with tamoxifen (90.9% vs. 67.9%, p = 0.031). For the remaining rs1065852 (C;C) and (C;T) patients, there was no significant difference between the 5-year DFS rates of those treated with one drug versus the other.It is also suggested that poor metabolizers of debrisoquine will be poor metabolizers of metoprolol, diltiazem (brand name cardizem), and propafenone.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4313">rs2506030 is a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in gene RET. Its ancestral/non-risk allele is A and derived allele G. RET (ret proto-oncogene) is a cadherin family member and encodes a receptor tyrosine kinases. Functionally, it is involved in neural crest development. It’s located on the plus strand at 10q11.2 of the human genome spanning over 50K bp. There are 21 exons in the gene and 2 isoforms. Other than Hirschsprung disease, mutations in this gene is also associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia And Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) or congenital aganglionosis is a developmental defect characterized by the absence of neuronal ganglia in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Patients can be classified into 3 sub categories based on the length of the colon: short segment, long segment, or total colonic aganglionosis (TCA). The incidence is roughly 15/100,000 in population of European descent and twice as high for Asians. HSCR is a non-Mendelian disease. Mutations in a few genes have been identified to be associated with HSCR: RET, GDNF, NRTN, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, ZEB2, PHOX2B, KIAA1279, TCF4, and L1CAM.rs2506030 was first identified by Charkravarti’s group in a family-based GWAS study published in 2015. A total of 220 European American trios with short-segment HSCR were recruited and their DNA genotyped using Affymetrix platform, resulting in 500,000 SNPs. Association was tested using case pseudo-control and rs2506030 is statistically significantly different in the two groups (p value 2.78 10^-15). Furthermore, the statistical significance was confirmed in a replication study of 429 more HSCR trios of all segment lengths (p value 2.02 10^-4, combined p value 4.44 10-15, odds ratio = 2.0). Note that rs2506030 is independent of another common RET SNP rs2435357, which is common in HSCR patients based on previous studies. They hypothesize that rs2506030 affects a RET enhancer. Another study by the same group further studied rs2506030 in HSCR patients. This study includes a population case control comparison as well as family based association testing. Comparing the allele frequencies in cases and controls, there was a significant difference between allele frequencies in rs2506030  (p value 4.7 10^-10). Similarly, there is significant statistical evidence (p value = 5.3 10^9) of higher frequency of risk allele homozygotes in cases. OR was estimated to be 1.8. In addition, TDT was performed in 254 trios and 72 duos and the risk allele is over transmitted to probands (p = 9.5 10^-6).</p>

This association has been observed in multiple populations (Caucasian, Asian, and African-Americans).The association was first noted in two relatively large studies of Caucasian patients.PMID 15657875, PMID 16642019In ~600 Korean SLE patients, the odds ratio for the rs2004640(T) risk allele was 1.44 (CI: 1.34-1.55, overall p=1.85x10e-23). The rs2004640-T/rs2280714-T haplotype involved in both the alternative splice donor site and the elevated expression of the IRF5 protein also had a highly significant association with SLE (pooled p=2.11x 10e-16). Reconfirmed for African-Americans Reconfirmed in ~370 female Caucasian patients Reconfirmed in ~380 UK SLE families Pooled data from two populations (Japanese and Korean) were combined to determine that the rs2004640(T) allele frequency was significantly increased in SLE patients (p = 8.3 x 10<sup>-5</sup>). A variant located 64 bp upstream of the first untranslated exon (exon 1A), consisting of a 5 bp insertion/deletion CGGGG (rs77571059), may be the causative SNP in this region that is most responsible for increasing SLE risk. In a Korean population, rs2004640 was associated with both the anti-CCP Ab-positive (odds ratio 1.47, CI: 1.15-1.88, pcorr = 0.01) and SE-positive group (odds ratio 1.54, CI: 1.14-2.09, pcorr = 0.03) forms of rheumatoid arthritis.  Combined analysis pooling 3 independent cohorts yielded an association with an odds ratio of 1.21, CI: 1.07-1.38, pooled p = 0.0031 in a dominant model. rs2004640(T;T) is associated with susceptibility to systemic sclerosis in a study of ~800 French Caucasian patients, with an odds ratio of 1.58 (CI: 1.18 - 2.11, p trend 0.002). A meta-analysis comprising 5 case-control studies, totaling 6,582 rheumatoid arthritis cases and 5,375 controls, concluded that several IRF5 gene SNPs were indeed (still) significantly associated with the disease. The rs2004640(G) allele was associated with a slight protective effect (odds ratio 0.9, CI: 0.85-0.96, p = 0.002). Of 3 IRF5 SNPs studied, the rs2280714(A) SNP (and not this one) had the strongest association (odds ratio 1.42, CI: 1.15-1.75) in Japanese SLE patients. Association with multiple sclerosis (along with several other SNPs) was observed after combining data from Swedish and Spanish case/control studies and a Finnish trio study.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3475">rs1064395 is a single nucleotide variant (SNV) found in the neurocan gene (NCAN) that has been implicated as a predictor of both bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia. BD is characterized by a fluctuation between manic episodes and severe depression.  Schizophrenia is characterized by hallucinations, both visual and auditory, paranoia, disorganized thinking and lack of normal social skills.  NCAN is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is involved in cell adhesion and migration.  It contains 14 exons and spans 41 kb of the genome at the location 19p12. OMIM It has also been found that, in mice, this gene is expressed in a localized way in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain which are responsible for cognition and regulation of emotions. In 2011, a study by Cichon et al identified rs1064395 in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for Bipolar Disorder (BD).  This study was done by analyzing around 500,000 autosomal SNPs and 12,000 X-chromosomal SNPS in 682 patients with BD and 1300 controls. The patients studied were from Europe, the USA, and Australia.  The study then went forward to test the top 48 hits from their initial GWAS with an independent cohort of 1729 cases and 2313 controls, which narrowed down their significant hits to a list of eight.  These eight were then used in a meta analysis.  The rs1064395 was highly significant with a p-value of 3.02X10-8 and an odds ratio of 1.31, with A being the risk allele. The authors then further validated with a much larger sample size (6030 cases and 31,749 controls) and found a p-value of 2.74X10-4 and an odds ratio of 1.12 which, combined with their previous study lead to an overall p-value of 2.14X10-9 and an odds ratio of 1.17. In 2012, a study by M&#252;hleisen et al investigated this same SNP in case control studies involving schizophrenic patients. They designed a patient-control study using samples from patients with European ancestry.  The initial study included a cohort of 5061 patients and 9655 controls.  The risk A-allele was found more frequently in schizophrenic patients then in controls with a p-value of 2.28X10 -8 and an odds ratio of 1.11.  They followed up this initial experiment using a independent cohort from the Schizophrenia Psychiatric GWAS Consortium that included 5537 patients and 8043 controls. This follow up inquiry yielded a p-value of 0.0239 and an odds ratio of 1.07.  Thus, these authors concluded that, not only is rs1064395 predictive of BD, it is also predictive of schizophrenia.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5122">rs1386494 is a SNP in the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) gene on chromosome 12.  It is located about 20,000 bp from the 5' end of the gene.   This SNP has been found to be associated with various mental health disorders.  TPH1 and TPH2 are two isoforms of the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of 5-HT (serotonin), a neurotransmitter involved in many neurological processes.  Both isoforms have been studied extensively as genetic markers of mental health.  Many association studies have linked the TPH1 gene to suicidality, alcoholism and depression.   However, the second TPH isoform was not discovered until more recently, when it was observed that TPH1 knockout mice were still able to produce normal levels of 5-HT.    It has been shown to be expressed exclusively in the brain, suggesting that it could play a major role in psychiatric disorders. The association between the SNP rs1386494 and major depression (MD) was first reported in a study of a cohort of 300 Caucasian patients with MD.  rs1386494 was found to be the most significantly associated of all 10 SNPs studied, with a p-value of 0.0012.   Another study of the association between the TPH2 gene and depression was conducted in a Finnish population of 119 patients who showed treatment risistance.  The researchers showed that A/A depression patients had significantly more severe depression, as measured by the Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), (p < 0.001) but showed a greater decline in MADRS score as a result of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment (p = 0.03).    Several other studies have confirmed the association of this SNP and linked SNPS with major depression. Similarly, rs1386494 has been linked to suicide attempts.  In a case study of 263 individuals who committed suicide and matched control patients, SNP, haplotype and LD studies support association between the TPH2 SNP and completed suicide.   However, a study of 150 alcohol-dependent patients reported no significant association with alcohol-related suicide behavior.   Both studies were conducted in Caucasian populations.More recently, studies have linked rs1386494 with schizophrenia in Asian populations.  In a case-control study of 289 Malaysians, the G allele was found to be enriched in schizophrenic patients.  Due to the low occurrence of suicidality in the study population, the authors rule out the role of suicidal behavior in this association, supporting a more direct neurological role of this SNP.  In a study of TPH2 SNPs in panic disorder, rs1386494 was found to have a gender-specific effect, where the association was seen only the female subgroup.</p>

This SNP is estimated to explain 9.6% of the total variation in the viral set point.Humans show remarkable variation in vulnerability to infection by HIV-1 and especially in the clinical outcome following infection. One striking and largely unexplained difference is the level of circulating virus in the plasma during the non-symptomatic phase preceding progression to AIDS. This is known as the ''viral set point'' and can vary among individuals by as much as 4 to 5 logs. The HCP5 (HLA complex P5) gene is located 100 kb centromeric from HLAB on chromosome 6.  HCP5 is a good candidate to interact with HIV-1, possibly through an antisense mechanism.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2549">In this 2007 article, titled "Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls," rs9272346 has been reported to be associated with type-1 diabetes. The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 5.49 (CI 4.83-6.24), and for homozygotes (AA), the risk is 18.52 (CI 12.69-27.03). The P value is extremely significant at 5.47 × 10-134, considering the threshold for genome-wide significance. NOTE: In previous edits of this page, it has been noted that "the (A) allele of rs9272346 is common in various human populations, and one could consider the (G) allele as protective." However, the authors of  seem to disagree. (Of course, other significant genetic and/or environmental factors could be protecting the multitude of individuals with AG). In several other lines of their table, the allele identified as the risk allele is _not_ the minor allele. The authors are aware of the conventions for ODs for risk vs. protection, stating that risk allele ODs will be normally 1-2 and protective ODS are between 0.5-1 (Supplement 1, page 3). In light of this, if they wished to signify the G allele was protective, they would have given a protective allele odds-ratio in the range 0.5-1 to AG. Of course, any OD as large as 5.49 (for AG), much less 18.25 (for AA) is quite a significant risk factor compared to all other ODs on its table. Yet it cannot be a typographical error, since the rs9272346 OD of 5.49 and P values were replicated in their Supplement 1 page 43.  Their significant P values were confirmed to some degree in a 2015 study listed on this page. In this 2015 article titled "Association of 32 type 1 diabetes risk loci in Pakistani patients," among 191 Pakistani cases and controls, the P value for rs9272346 was (p = 2.83E − 09). However, no risk allele or odds ratio was mentioned. They cited the 2007 study on this page. They noted that "it has been difficult to determine individual effects of HLA genes 17."

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="952">rs4810485 is a SNP associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. At this locus, the minor allele, T, protects against RA. The SNP is located on chromosome 20q13 in the second intron of the CD40 gene, which encodes a receptor that is expressed on the surface of multiple immune cells. CD40 binds the ligand CD154 which is expressed by activated T cells, and this interaction plays a critical role in T cell helper activity in the immune system. rs4810495 is closely linked with another SNP, rs1883832, that appears to lesson translation of the CD40 gene, affecting this critical signaling pathway that leads to B cell proliferation . Mouse model knockouts of CD40 have been shown to alleviate arthritis . The association between rs4810485 and RA was first identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis and two subsequent replication studies in patients with European ancestry . This study looked at the major allele G versus the minor allele T in a meta-analysis of previous GWAS followed by two replication studies. In the GWAS meta-analysis, which had 3,393 cases and 12,460 controls, they found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2.4x10-7 and an odds ratio of 0.83. Two replication studies looking at 31 loci in combined 3,929 cases and 5,807 controls found the position to be associated with the disease with a p-value of 0.0032 and an odds ratio of 0.91. Jointly, the meta-analysis and replication studies showed an association with a p-value of 8.2x10-9 surpassing a conservative level of significance for joint analysis and an odds ratio of 0.87, suggesting that the minor allele T gives a modest protective effect against RA.The association with RA was confirmed in a targeted validation study in the United Kingdom with 3,962 cases and 3,531 control patients . This study found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2x10-4 and an odds ratio of 0.86. Since this was a targeted study looking at 4 specific loci, the p-value is significant. Again, the odds ratio suggests a modest protective affect for the minor allele T.An additional study looked at this SNP and its association with RA in individuals of Korean ancestry . This study found no association between rs4810485 and RA in patients with Korean ancestry. The targeted validation study looked at 5 SNPs associated with RA in Europeans in 1,113 Korean cases and 988 controls, and found a p-value of 0.39 and an odds ratio of 1.06, suggesting no association between the SNP and RA in Koreans. This case highlights the importance of accounting for ancestry when testing genome-wide associations.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="152">This SNP, in the ACTN3 gene, encodes a premature stop codon in a muscle protein called alpha-actinin-3. The polymorphism alters position 577 of the alpha-actinin-3 protein. In publications the (C;C) genotype is often called RR, whereas the (T;T) genotype is often called XX. According to  (T;T) is under-represented in elite strength athletes, consistent with previous reports indicating that alpha-actinin-3 deficiency appears to impair muscle performance. However in 2016   failed to replicate casting some doubt. The most common nucleotide at this position, (C), encodes an arginine (amino acid code R), the alternative T allele encodes a stop codon (X). Hence, the SNP is referred to as R577X, with homozygotes being either RR or XX and heterozygotes being RX. XX individuals completely lack the expression of alpha-actinin-3.One of the earliest report studying a relatively small number of Australian elite (i.e. ~Olympic) athletes found that, at least in females, the R allele (ie rs1815739(C)) is associated with sprinters, while the X allele (rs1815739(T)) is associated with endurance athletes. No female or Olympic-level sprinters were XX homozygotes (rs1815739(T;T)). The association tended the same way but was statistically weaker in males. . There have been several subsequent studies, but few with large sample sizes and thus few with much statistical power.

Rs10766071 has been associated with shorter sleep duration as measured by polysomnography&#8212; a method for recording the activity of the brain, eyes, muscles, and heart while the subject sleeps. The A allele (major allele) is associated with higher sleep duration and the G allele (minor allele) is associated with shorter sleep duration (n=414). However, only one individual with the GG genotype was in the study. G is the ancestral allele and is also the minor variant (frequency = .0851) (dbSNP).ARNTL encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS domain transcription factor (PMID:11163178).Studies have shown that ARNTL is an important component of the transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) which regulates circadian rhythms. Homozygous ARNTL null mutant mice loose circadian rhythmicity, as measured by activity patterns, when transferred to constant darkness, demonstrating that ARNTL plays a key role in maintaining circadian rhythmicity (PMID:11163178). Rs1076671 was one of 13 significant SNPs (after Bonferroni correction) discovered by Kripke et al. (PMID:25660813) to be associated with sleep variables. Their study consisted of a cohort of patients of likely European ancestry who were recruited from a &#8220;busy academic sleep practice.&#8221; Patients consisted mostly of individuals who had been given a tentative diagnosis of sleep apnea, and had been sent for a polysomnography to confirm. All patients were 21 years or older.The authors of the paper collected DNA samples from the patients and then performed custom Illumina golden gate assay for 768 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This subset of SNPs was chosen because they were relevant to circadian rhythm regulation. Patients were surveyed about their sleep schedule and habits and polysomnographs were recorded of each patient. Thirty-eight phenotypic measures were analyzed. The authors performed linear or logistic regression analyses and then performed a Bonferroni correction for the total number of SNPs tested. The p-value for this association was 5.3x10-5 prior to Bonferroni correction. Importantly, this SNP is not genome-wide significant.  References: Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP).

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5099">rs3729547, is a SNP that was recently shown to be mildly associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  in the Han Chinese population and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Indian population.  . This SNP is located within  the coding sequence of the TNNT2 gene, which encodes a component of the troponin complex critical for proper sarcomeric contractility in cardiomyocytes, the cell type driving contraction in the heart. A number of earlier studies have shown that mutations in TNNT2 can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.    characterized by a thinning of the ventricular wall, or conversely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by a thickening of the ventricular wall. Both conditions lead to an overall weakening of the heart muscle and can lead to heart failure or sudden cardiac death.  The molecular mechanisms whereby mutations in the same gene (TNNT2) can lead to two diseases (DCM and HCM) with such contrasting phenotypes are still not well-understood. In a study by Li et al, rs3729547 (C to T) and another tagging SNP also in TNNT2, rs3729843 (G to A),  were shown to be associated with DCM in a cohort of Han Chinese individuals (X2= 6.63, P = 0.036; X2 = 9.787, P = 0.008, respectively) The risk allele for rs3729547 is T and the risk allele for rs3729843 is A. rs3729547 is a synonymous (isoleucine) variant whereas rs3729843 is a noncoding SNP. In this study, the authors investigated the association between 10 tagging SNPs (these two included) and DCM using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). However, the patients from this study were all members of the Han Chinese population, and therefore, these SNPs must be studied in the context of another ethnic group to validate strong associations between these SNPs and DCM. Additionally, this study was limited by its sample size, as only 97 DCM patients and 189 healthy unrelated controls partook in this study. In a second study published by Rani et al, the TNNT2 gene was sequenced in 162 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and in 179 healthy controls. HCM phenotype ranged from moderate to severe, but a limited number of corrective operations were performed in these HCM patients. In contrast to the Li et al paper, this study was conducted exclusively in patients from India. Fifteen associated variants were uncovered, including rs3729547 (C to T) and rs3729843 (G to A), which were found to be in high linkage disequilibrium in the HCM patients. They also identified a 5bp deletion polymorphism in this Indian population that was previously shown to be associated with HCM patients of French, Spanish, and Japanese origin.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4745">rs736893 is related to sickle cell anemia, a genetic disease in which red blood cells form an abnormal crescent shape as opposed to the normal disc shape /. In the United States, it's estimated that sickle cell anemia affects 70,000&#8211;100,000 people, mainly African Americans. A New England Journal of Medicine study conducted in the US reported an average life expectancy of 42 in males and 48 in females . The landmark 1949 Science paper titled " Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease by Pauling established the molecular basis for this sickle cell anemia and introduced notions that will become central to molecular medicine.  Sickle cell leg ulcers are common complications of sickle cell anemia . As of 2010, despite the fact that this complication has been recognized since the early times of sickle cell disease, there has been little improvement in the efficacy of its management and clinical outcome over the past 100 years . In a  study, investigators found significant associations between rs736839 (18q21.1) and sickle cell leg ulcers. Using the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm to control FDR, this SNP was the only one found with FDR under 10%. In this study, the odds ratio for rs736893 was 1.95, with 95% confidence interval of (1.35&#8211;2.82). Homozygous C is associated with elevated levels of risk for sickle cell leg ulcers. In contrast, having at least one of T is considered less risky. This case-control study involved 387 cases and 920 controls. The genotype associations were adjusted for sex and age because men and older individuals are more likely to be afflicted .Although not in a gene, rs736839 is adjacent to SMAD7, which is part of the Transforming Growth Factor&#8211;b/Bone Morphogenetic Protein (TGF-beta/BMP) pathway. In a separate case-control SNP association study, IGF1R and genes in the TGF-beta / BMP pathway has been linked to sickle cell anemia .The Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions. In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGF-beta signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGF-beta superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1611">(Published 2008) Researchers noted that reduced fT3/fT4 ratios may be significant, since various bodily tissues and organs differ in their level of dependence on fT3 and fT4. They analyzed 18 SNPs of DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3 and measured thyroid hormone levels in 552 people on L-T4 hormone replacement therapy, and three healthy control groups not on L-T4 therapy (totalling 2513 people). Analysis was adjusted for age and sex.   Among patients, the _minor_ allele of rs11206244 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio from 0.193 in Common homozygous to 0.175 in Minor homozygous (-0.18) p for trend = 0.004).   Among patients, the _major_ allele of rs2235544 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio (from 0.196 in Minor homozygous to 0.177 in Common homozygous (-.019), p for trend = 0.01).   The two SNPs rs2235544 and rs11206244, were in linkage disequilibrium (LD)  (r2 = 0.41), and rs2235544 was driving the association.   Polymorphisms of rs2235544 in both cases and controls achieved genome-wide significance for effect on fT3/fT4 ratio(p=3.6x10-13) in the general population, each minor allele increasing the ratio by 0.2SD.  Polymorphism did not affect TSH levels.   None of the SNPs in the other deiodinase genes DIO2 DIO3 influenced T3, T4 or TSH serum levels.   Reverse T3 (rT3) levels were not studied.  Regardless of the polymorphism of rs2235544, the fT3:fT4 ratio and fT3 levels were consistently and significantly lower in hypothyroid patients on L-T4 therapy than in healthy controls, and patients' mean TSH was also lower than in controls.  A 2014 study "Effect of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, DIO1 and DIO2 polymorphisms on L-thyroxine doses required for TSH suppression in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer" confirmed an earlier study's finding of LD (linkage disequilibrium) between rs11206244 T and rs2235544 A in DIO1.  A 2013 study "A Meta-Analysis of Thyroid-Related Traits Reveals Novel Loci and Gender-Specific Differences in the Regulation of Thyroid Function" explained that "even mild alterations in thyroid function are associated with weight changes, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disorders." (Abstract). The study focused on genome-wide association data in 26,420 euthyroid (healthy, not hypothyroid or hyperthyroid) individuals phenotyped for serum TSH and 17,520 for FT4 levels. The meta-analysis highlighted a list of 26 SNPs from a wide variety of genes.   For DIO1 rs2235544 A/C, the A allele (51% frequency) was associated with an increase in FT4 levels, with a slightly larger effect on males than females. . This 2008 review discussed findings from previous research. The C allele of rs2235544 was associated with increased D1 function and increased FT3/T4 ratio.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2847">rs11208534 is a polymorphism within intron 3 of the Janus-activated kinase (JAK1) gene on human chromosome 1.  This SNP is reported by dbSNP as having A (ancestral) and G alleles, with a minor allele frequency of 19.2% (dbSNP). JAK1 is a membrane-associated protein-tyrosine kinase involved in the interferon-alpha/beta and &#8211;gamma pathways, which are important for immune responses to pathogens. Activation of JAK-family proteins occurs after binding of interferons to cell-surface receptors, and results in tyrosine phosphorylation of members of the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) protein family, inducing the expression of many other genes involved in diverse biological processes including various antiviral responses .This SNP has been associated with increased risk of developing severe symptoms upon infection with dengue virus. Symptoms of dengue infection vary widely in severity, and are classified by the WHO (listed in order of increasing severity) as undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and severe hypovolemic shock, or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DF commonly includes high fever, general flu-like symptoms, and sometimes severe bleeding. DHF is characterized by high fever, major hemorrhaging, circulatory failure, and extremely low blood platelet counts and if untreated can progress to DSS ( correlation was found between rs11208534 and the development of symptoms consistent with DHF in a 2010 study in Brazil of individuals seropositive for dengue virus . The top hit out of 728 SNPs in 56 genes predicted to be involved in a cellular response to viral infection was rs11208534, for which the authors report T (major) and C (minor) alleles of rs11208534, not A and G as on dbSNP. Cases (n = 50) were recruited from patients with DHF-like symptoms by active hospital surveillance in the city of Salvador, Brazil. Controls (n = 236) who had experienced symptoms of DF, but not DHF, were recruited from families living within 1 kilometer of index cases, and were matched in age categories under and over 15 years. The association between rs11208534 and DHF (P-value 2.9x10-4; OR 5.2 (95% CI 2.1-12.7) just failed to reach the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 2.6x10-4 by itself, but when combined with two other highly linked SNPs in the JAK1 gene region, rs310196 and rs2780831 (D&#8217; 0.856 and 1.0 to rs11208534 respectively), the association reached significance with a P-value of 2.1x10-4. This study provides evidence that polymorphisms in the JAK1 gene, including this one, may provide differential susceptibility to dengue virus infection, and likely other viruses as well. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is associated with polymorphisms in JAK1  Mechanisms of type-I- and type-II-interferon-mediated signalling</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1388">rs762551, also known as -164A>C or -163C>A, is a SNP encoding the CYP1A2 1F allele of the CYP1A2 gene. CYP1A2 is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of caffeine and some drugs.The baseline activity of the enzyme is similar in CYP1A2 1F allele carriers and non-carriers. However, rs762551(A) codes for the "high inducibility" form of the enzyme, characterized by higher enzyme activity in the presence of an inducer such as smoking or heavy coffee consumption . In non-smokers, there was no significant difference in CYP1A2 activity between the genotypes. In smokers, however, the A/A homozygotes had 1.6x higher CYP1A2 activity than A/C and C/C genotypes . Similarly, among non-smokers, only in heavy coffee consumers (more than 3 cups daily) the A/A homozygotes had about 1.4x higher CYP1A2 activity. There was no differences in CYP1A2 activity by genotype in non-heavy coffee consumers. A study of healthy premenopausal non-hormone using women concluded that drinkers of 3 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have lower breast volume (smaller breasts), but only if they had at least one rs762551(C) allele (p(interaction)=0.02), which was said to be consistent with reports that coffee protects only C-allele carriers against breast cancer.Another study by this same group looked at coffee consumption as related to breast cancer. Among 458 such patients (age 25-99 years), rs762551(A;A) women (about 1/2 of the total study) who drank 2 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have a later age at diagnosis compared with low coffee consumption (59.8 versus 52.6 years, p = 0.0004). These patients were also more likely to have ER- tumors than patients with low consumption (14.7% versus 0%, p = 0.018). Coffee consumption had no associations in carriers of a rs762551(C) allele.An independent study of 411 BRCA1 mutation carriers (170 cases and 241 controls) looked at the association between breast cancer, coffee consumption before age 35, and CYP1A2 genotype. While CYP1A2 genotype did not affect breast cancer risk, women with at least one rs762551(C) allele who consumed coffee had a 64% reduction in breast cancer risk, compared with women who never consumed coffee (odds ratio 0.36, CI: 0.18-0.73). No such protective effect was seen in rs762551(A;A) women.A study of 2,000 Costa Ricans who survived a first heart attack observed a general trend between coffee consumption and increased risk among carriers of rs762551(C) alleles, i.e. more coffee led to increased nonfatal heart attack risk. No association was seen for rs762551(A;A) individuals.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="337">This position is odd. Under the older reference genome build36, it was on the plus strand; in build37 it is on the minus strand. This makes it very prone to some ambiguous flip confusion in the literature, plus, 23andMe users have self-reported the flipped form. IN addition, instead of the usual SNP listed as having 2 alleles, all 4 alleles are reported in dbSNP, even if this is probably due to the strand changes. dbSNP currently says the normal allele is C, and T is the rare geno which causes a premature stop, early in the gene. We at SNPedia suspect that the A & G alleles are not common enough to have ever been genuinely reported, but for de-novo mutations each allele would be non-synonymous and result in a different amino acid. , a SNP located in the AMPD1 gene and also known as 'C34T', has at times been called the "most prevalent genetic disease mutation", at least in Caucasians.  Perhaps up to 10% of Caucasians and African-American carry one C34T allele (i.e. carry one rs17602729(A) allele) - and actually, most of them are unaware of any medically related issues since they don't typically have any particular symptoms that would warrant a trip to the doctor.So what's the issue? The AMPD1 gene encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase, which is one of the key enzymes used to process the energy source ATP. The C34T variation causes a premature stop in the protein, leading to a nonfunctional AMPD1 enzyme. Some individuals - but by no means all or even a majority apparently - who are AMPD1 deficient get muscle cramps and pains when they exert themselves. The most common genotype bringing this about is rs17602729(A;A), i.e. the individuals who carry two copies of the C34T allele and therefore have no functioning AMPD1 allele. It is not known why only some of C34T homozygotes experience muscle myalgia.Heterozygotes, i.e. rs17602729(A;G) individuals, do not seem to suffer any exercise or fitness related deficit. In fact, one of the best elite Caucasian distance runners is known to be a C34T heterozygote. In fact, heterozygotes for rs17602729 may even have advantages over those lacking a C34T allele. The most striking study reported that C34T heterozygotes are 8.6 fold (CI: 3.05 - 23.87) more likely to survive for more than 5 years without needing a heart transplant after a congestive heart failure related hospitalization than the wild-type homozygotes (i.e. rs17602729(G;G) homozygotes).  Similarly, C34T heterozygotes with coronary artery disease seem to fare better than wild-type homozygotes. This is one of the SNPs reported by NutraHacker SNPs|NutraHacker.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1484">Also known as c.506-1G>A or 1846G>A, the normal (or wild type) form of this SNP is a (G) as defined on the reverse/minus strand. The (A) form disrupts proper mRNA formation, resulting in a nonfunctional CYP2D6 protein. The associated allele is also known as CYP2D6 4. The CYP2D6 4 allele is the most common nonfunctioning variant of CYP2D6.If two copies of this (or similar) changes are inherited, poor metabolism ('PM') of debrisoquine  is observed. Many other drugs are typically first metabolized by CYP2D6 including dextromorphan, sparteine, metoprolol, nortriptyline and many other antidepressants and codeine. Of course, sometimes the active form of a drug is the one post-CYP2D6 metabolism; an example of this is tamoxifen, where the active form (endoxifen) is formed primarily via CYP2D6 metabolism; less functioning CYP2D6 can mean less benefit from taking the drug.The CYP2D6 4 allele (i.e. rs3892097(A)) has been postulated by researchers over the years to have many potential consequences, both positive and negative.On the positive side: this allele may reduce the risk of certain cancers, such as bladder and lung , and it may correlate with somwhat less severe neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's .On the other hand, at least two studies PMID 14991823, PMID 15174030 have concluded that the risk of developing Parkinson's disease upon exposure to pesticides is increased from 3 to 8 fold among carriers of CYP2D6 4 alleles. The risk to CYP2D6 4 carriers appears proportional to the degree of pesticide exposure, with no additional risk of developing Parkinson's seen for CYP2D6 4 carriers with no pesticide exposure, and the highest increased risk of developing Parkinson's seen for CYP2D6 4 carriers with frequent exposure to pesticides.Patients prescribed tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) who are homozygous for the CYP2D6 4 allele metabolize these drugs more slowly, which puts them at higher risk for adverse side effects. A study of ~1100 Dutch patients reports: (1) 6 fold more side effects upon switching antidepressants for CYP2D6 4 homozygotes, but not for heterozygotes, and (2) that the effective and maintenance doses of antidepressants for CYP2D6 4 homozygotes are lower than for patients with one or more higher metabolizing CYP2D6 alleles. rs3892097(A;A) patients taking a beta blocker drug such as metoprolol are at ~4x increased risk for bradycardia, based on a study of 1,533 patients in the Rotterdam Study. These CYP2D6  4/ 4 homozygotes have the 'poor metabolizer' (PM) phenotypes, and had adjusted heart rates that were 8.5 beats/min lower compared with  1/ 1 extensive metabolizers (EMs) (p < 0.001), leading to an increased risk of bradycardia in PMs (odds ratio of 3.86, CI: 1.68-8.86,  p = 0.0014).</p>

The small number of homozygous carriers in the study probably explains this outlier. A 2010 study  of 2888 cases and 4483 controls could not reproduce the association of this SNP with ovarian cancer, even adjusting for ethnicity and BMI. The study concludes their sample size had >90% power to detect OR 1.3 for this SNP, so if an effect exists it must be quite small. A pooled analysis of 4788 ovarian cancer cases and 7614 controls in 2008 suggested that PROGINS risk is limited to invasive endometrioid subtype , to that effect a 2010 study found association with endometrial cancer  with same risk haplotypes as the earlier haplotype study on ovarian cancer. A 2014 metastudy  however did find association between PROGINS and ovarian cancer, but statistically significant only for Caucasians, those having never used oral contraceptives, and serous (endometrial) cancers, while another meta-study  looking at endometrial cancer specifically found association (OR 1.52-2.72, p = 0.0008-0.03) among European women in particular.This SNP has also been reported to be associated with migraine-associated vertigo (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0007). SNPs in genes involved in female hormonal pathways have been a subject of particular interest in the study of migraines because females appear to be more prone to migraines than males. Previous studies had suggested that the minor allele of this SNP might also influence breast cancer. However, a 2009 European study of 30,000 breast cancer cases, compared to 30,000 controls, found no association, or as they put it, "persuasive evidence against an overall association between invasive breast cancer risk and (this SNP)".

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3159">Also known as "C/T(-13910)" or just 13910T, and located in the MCM6 gene but with influence on the lactase LCT gene, rs4988235 is one of two SNPs that is associated with the primary haplotype associated with hypolactasia, more commonly known as lactose intolerance in European populations. , In these populations, the rs4988235(T) allele is both the more common allele and the one associated with lactase persistence; individuals who are rs4988235(C;C) are likely to be lactose intolerant.Note that while lactose intolerance is usually reported only for rs4988235(C;C) homozygotes, at least one publication finds that lactase enzyme activity actually forms a continuum across the three rs4988235 genotypes, being lowest in C/C homozygotes, intermediate in T/C heterozygotes, and highest in T/T homozygotes. It is therefore likely the heterozygotes may also experience symptoms of lactose intolerance at times (depending on age and amount of lactose).In populations of sub-Saharan Africans, though, the rs4988235(T) allele is so rare that it's unlikely to be predictive of lactase persistence, and other SNPs are predictive instead.

Some studies report that the less common rs1501299(G) allele, is associated with decreased cancer risk compared with the more common (T) allele.A study of 733 breast cancer cases for 10 SNPs concluded that the rs2241766(G;T) genotype, in combination with certain genotypes at rs1501299, was at reduced risk (odds ratio 0.61, CI: 0.46-0.80). After categorizing individuals by adiponectin signaling status, this study found that compared with low signalers (the most frequent), intermediate signalers had a 0.64x decrease in breast cancer risk (CI: 0.49–0.83), and high signalers had a 0.15x lower breast cancer risk (CI: 0.02–1.28, p(trend) = 0.001).Adiponectin signaling status was assigned as follows (as oriented in dbSNP):rs1501299(C,C) + rs2241766(T,T) = low signaler<br>rs1501299(A,C) + rs2241766(T,T) = low signaler<br>rs1501299(C,C) + rs2241766(G,T) = low signaler<br>rs1501299(A,A) + rs2241766(T,T) = intermediate signaler<br>rs1501299(A,C) + rs2241766(G,T) = intermediate signaler<br>rs1501299(C,C) + rs2241766(G,G) = intermediate signaler<br>rs1501299(A,C) + rs2241766(G,G) = high signaler<br>rs1501299(A,A) + rs2241766(G,G) = high signaler<br>rs1501299(A,A) + rs2241766(G,T) = high signaler<br>Based on these criteria, adiponectin signaling status is now determined by genosets Gs325 and Gs326 for Promethease users.Note that  adiponectin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue (body fat), is involved in lipid metabolism.In other words, you are a low adiponectin signaler, and thus have basically average breast cancer risk, if you have one of these combinations of alleles: rs1501299  CC and also rs2241766 either GT or TT rs1501299  AC and also rs2241766 TTYou are an intermediate adiponectin signaler (Gs325), and thus possibly at 0.64x reduced risk of breast cancer compared to low signallers, if you have one of these combinations of alleles:  rs1501299 CC and also rs2241766 GG  rs1501299 AC and also rs2241766 GT  rs1501299 AA and also rs2241766 TTYou are a high adiponectin signaler (Gs326), and thus have the lowest (perhaps 0.15x) risk if you have one of these combinations of alleles:  rs1501299 AC and also rs2241766 GG  rs1501299 AA and also rs2241766 either GG or GT</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1609">(Published 2008) Researchers noted that reduced fT3/fT4 ratios may be significant, since various bodily tissues and organs differ in their level of dependence on fT3 and fT4. They analyzed 18 SNPs of DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3 and measured thyroid hormone levels in 552 people on L-T4 hormone replacement therapy, and three healthy control groups not on L-T4 therapy (totalling 2513 people). Analysis was adjusted for age and sex.   Among patients, the _minor_ allele of rs11206244 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio from 0.193 in Common homozygous to 0.175 in Minor homozygous (-0.18) p for trend = 0.004).   Among patients, the _major_ allele of rs2235544 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio (from 0.196 in Minor homozygous to 0.177 in Common homozygous (-.019), p for trend = 0.01).   The two SNPs rs2235544 and rs11206244, were in linkage disequilibrium (LD)  (r2 = 0.41), and rs2235544 was driving the association.   Polymorphisms of rs2235544 in both cases and controls achieved genome-wide significance for effect on fT3/fT4 ratio(p=3.6x10-13) in the general population, each minor allele increasing the ratio by 0.2SD.  Polymorphism did not affect TSH levels.   None of the SNPs in the other deiodinase genes DIO2 DIO3 influenced T3, T4 or TSH serum levels.   Reverse T3 (rT3) levels were not studied.  Regardless of the polymorphism of rs2235544, the fT3:fT4 ratio and fT3 levels were consistently and significantly lower in hypothyroid patients on L-T4 therapy than in healthy controls, and patients' mean TSH was also lower than in controls.  A 2012 study "The Relationship of Deiodinase 1 Genotype and Thyroid Function to Lifetime History of Major Depression in Three Independent Populations," researchers "confirmed prior findings that two variants in deiodinase 1 (DIO1), including a variant in the 3’ UTR of DIO1 (rs11206244), were associated with altered free thyroxine (FT4) levels in both White and African American subjects. We also found that rs11206244 genotype was associated with lifetime MD (Major Depression) in White female subjects, in particular those from high-risk cohorts. However, we found no association of current FT4 levels with lifetime MD in either ethnic group. We conclude that genetic variation influencing thyroid function is a risk factor for MD." (Abstract) This 2008 review discussed findings from previous research, such as: Carriers of the T allele of (rs11206244) exhibited higher rT3/T4 and lower T3/rT3 ratios in serum, suggesting a negative effect of this variant on D1 expression and/or activity.  In contrast, the G allele of (rs12095080) correlated with lower rT3/T4 and higher T3/rT3 ratios, suggesting increased D1 expression and/or activity of this variant.  the C allele of rs2235544 was associated with increased D1 function and increased FT3/T4 ratio.</p>

In "Association of the ADRA2A polymorphisms with the risk of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis." a meta-analysis of publications prior to September 2012 showed no overall association between rs553668 and T2D risk, but did find an association with very high (poor) P-value for Europeans under recessive gene model (GT=AA, OR=1.36, p=0.02, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.76).In "Genetic association of adrenergic receptor alpha 2A with obesity and type 2 diabetes." rs553668 was found to correlate with obesity in Swedish population, but not significantly for BMI-corrected T2D risk. ADRA2A is involved in sympathetic nervous system's inhibition of insulin secretion and lipolysis, so direct effect on T2D is usually sought, but the Swedish study suggest it could work through body mass.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="403">Apolipoprotein E ApoE status is technically defined by two different SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412.  This SNP, rs4420638, is situated about 14kb away in the adjacent ApoC1 gene and is co-inherited with ApoE and thus associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.rs4420638 (the proxy SNP) is not independent of rs429358. These two SNPs are correlated with each other and it's believed that most of the association with AD at rs4420638 is due to its proximity to rs429358. That said, rs4420638 is not a perfect proxy for rs429358 either -- rs4420638 correlates better for certain genotypes and for certain ethnicities. For example, if you have the genotype at rs4420638 that is more correlated with the e4 allele of APOE, you still only have a 50% chance of actually having the e4 allele. And rs4420638 is not very predictive for any genotype in African populations. The (G;G) form of this SNP indicates increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, however the probability and amount of increased risk is subject to some disagreement. The initial report concerning this SNP indicated a high likelihood that rs4420638(G;G) homozygotes were predictably ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes and thus at significantly (15 fold or higher) risk for Alzheimer's. However, one testing service has estimated pers. communication that 25% to 50% of people with the (G;G) are  not  actually ApoE4 homozygotes, and are more likely to be at ~2-3x increased risk based on being ApoE3/ApoE4 heterozygotes. If you were tested on deCODEme or 23andMe v3 platform, ignore this proxy and just check your status at rs429358 and rs7412. 23andme added rs429358 for people who tested on the v3 platform on 04/14/2011, so you should re-download your data if you haven't.This  AlzForum.org article suggests that ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes have a ~15-fold increased risk for developing the disease compared to ApoE3/ApoE3 carriers, whereas rs4420638(A;G) individuals have a ~3-fold increased risk.ApoE4 status is notable as being the variation that several well known scientists, including Nobel Prize winner User:Watson|James Watson, request not to learn when having their own genomes analyzed.Meta-analyses have also supported the association between the ApoE4 allele and somewhat increased risk for heart disease, with an odds ratio of 1.42 (CI: 1.26 - 1.61)./ 23andMe blog each rs4420638(G) lowered CRP by 21.8% also associated with higher total cholesterol, LDL choelsterol and triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterolNote: the :Category:On_chip_Affy500k|Affymetrix 500K chip is said to poorly tag (ie assay) this particular SNP.

Otitis or ear infections   Children who are rs361525(G;G) homozygotes may be more prone to ear infections; adjusted odds ratio 2.29, p=0.03).   Nasal polyps   The rs361525(A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk for nasal polyps in a study of 82 Turkish patients.   Psoriasis   A study of 160 Polish psoriasis patients indicated that the frequency of the rs361525(A) allele was significantly increased (16.8% vs. 3.1%, p=0.000017, odds ratio 8.79, CI: 2.606-29.678), and furthermore, the onset age was lower in rs361525(A) carriers.   Diabetes and verbal memory   rs361525(A) carriers showed a slower decline of verbal memory over a period of 48 weeks in a study of elderly patients with type-2 diabetes.   Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)   rs361525(G;G) babies may be at higher risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) based on a relatively small number (148) of Norwegian infants studied.   Exfoliation glaucoma   A study of 204 patients with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) concluded that rs361525 is unlikely to be a major risk factor for XFG in Caucasians.   Lymphoma  A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. Five SNPs in two cytokine genes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha, were associated with a 1.31x increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63; P = 0.01) and with a 1.64x increase in the subtype known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23-2.19; P = 0.0007). The other four SNPS are listed below. The cytokine genes affect inflammatory and innate immune responses.   rs1800629   rs1799724   rs909253   rs2239704</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2655">rs6318 (Cys23Ser / C23S or 68G>C / G68C) is a SNP within the serotonin 2C receptor HTR2C gene located on the X chromosome. Since it is located on the X chromosome, males will be hemizygous and either (C;-) or (G;-), whereas females will either homozygous (C;C) or (G;G) or heterozygous (C;G). In most of the studies cited below, heterozyous (C;G) females were roughly statistically equivalent to females carrying the common non-risk (G;G) genotype.One relatively large (4,000 men and 2,000 women) study published in late 2013 of Caucasian catheterization patients has studied the association between rs6318 genotype and risk of having an "end" cardiac event, defined as either death or a heart attack, in the years following entry into the study (i.e. presumably following their catheterization). Patients were followed for up to 11 years, with a median follow-up time of 5.3 years. Different rs6318 genotypes had statistically significant differences in their odds of having end cardiac events as follows: 29% of (G;-) men; 35% of (C;-) men; ~26% of (G;G) or (C;G) women; and 36% of (C;C) women. This works out to hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model for male rs6318(C;-) compared to the more common (G;-) males of 1.23 (CI: 1.02-1.36, p=0.02), and 1.62 (CI:1.07-2.47, p=0.02) for female (C;C) genotypes compared to the more common (G;G) females. The authors postulate that rs6318 is associated with higher stress-related cortisol levels, and suggest (without any evidence so far) that rs6318(C;C) women and (C;-) men may benefit from either behavioural therapy or the use of a serotonin receptor antagonist such as agomelatine.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4740">'''rs12913975''' is an A/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the SMAD6 gene that has been associated with the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The most common nucleotide or 'major allele' of this SNP is G, which is also the dominant allele. The minor allele is A, which according to data from the 1000 Genomes project occurs in the sampled population at a frequency of 15.8% (observed 345 times in 2183 people). HapMap data (July 2005) from 1208 individuals from 13 populations included population specific genotype frequencies for this SNP  dbSNP.A 2011 study published by Li ''et al.'' examined 33 SNPs in 13 TGF-beta pathway genes to estimate the effect of genotype on brain metastasis in 116 NSCLC patients. The authors found that NSCLC patients with the G/G genotype of the rs12913975 SNP had a significantly increased risk of brain metastasis compared to patients with the A/G genotype over the two years following initial time of lung cancer diagnosis (hazard risk: 2.540, 95% confidence interval: 1.204-5.359, p = 0.014). Hazard ratios and confidence intervals were estimated using cox proportional hazards model for the multivariate survival analyses adjusted for sex, age, clinical stage, tumor histology, Karnofsky performance status, and smoking status. A two-tailed t- test was used to determine significance of associations. This finding may allow clinicians to use the rs12913975 SNP as a measure of an NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of developing brain metastasis. It is not known whether this SNP plays a functional role in the potential of NSCLC tumors to metastasize to the brain. However, the SNP is located in the SMAD6 gene, an inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling that is a pathway affected in different cancers, so this may in fact be a functional variant  PMID: 23284751.In 2011 Lin ''et al.'' determined the effect of genotype on survival in 598 advanced-stage NSCLC patients across 227 SNPs in 23 TGF-beta pathway-related genes to estimate. The authors identified the rs12913975 SNP as a genetic variant significantly associated with the overall survival of NSCLC patients (hazard risk: 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.59, p = 0.01). Furthermore, they found that the G/G allele of this SNP had a significant positive effect on the survival of NSCLC patients using chemoradiation (hazard risk: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.90, p = 0.01), but that this trend was not significant when patients used only chemotherapy (hazard risk: 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.56-1.02, p = 0.29). Hazard ratios and confidence intervals were estimated using cox proportional hazards model for the multivariate survival analyses adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, clinical stager, pretreatment PS, and therapy modality. A two-tailed chi-squared or Fisher&#8217;s exact test was used to determine significance of associations.  PMID: 21515830</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2593">rs138213197, also known as c.251G>A, p.Gly84Glu and G84E, is a SNP in the homeobox transcription factor HOXB13 gene located in a cluster of HOX genes on ch 17q21&#8211;22. This gene is a member of the abdominal B subfamily, which have posterior domains of expression, including in the vertebrate urogenital system. HOXB13 maintains a relatively high level of expression in the adult prostate. G84E consists of the non-conservative replacement of a glutamic acid for a glycine at this position in the HOXB13 protein.In early 2012, findings were published based on exome sequencing of 200 genes spanning the ch17q21-22 region of primarily Caucasian prostate cancer patients (and matched controls). Deemed a "rare but recurring mutation", rs138213197(T) was discovered and then validated in a larger case-case study. Overall, rs138213197(T) was reported to lead to a 20-fold higher risk for prostate cancer, based on having been observed in 72 of ~5,000 patients but in only 1 person out of 1400 controls (so overall odds ratio 20.1, CI: 3.5 - 803.3, p=8.5&#215;10&#8722;7).Subsequent studies convincingly replicate this result:    Confirmed with odds ratio of 7.1 (CI: 4.62&#8211;10.78, p = 10e-19) based on 10,000 patients of various ethnicities (and ~60,000 controls).    Confirmed with odds ratio of 3.4 (CI: 2.2&#8211;5.4, p = 10e-6 or less) based on 5,000 Swedish patients. For this population, male G84E carriers have an estimated 33% cumulative risk to age 80 yr of prostate cancer, compared to 12% (CI: 11&#8211;13) among noncarriers.     Confirmed with odds ratio of 5.8 (CI: 1.3 - 26.5, p = .01) based on 1,800 Canadian patients.    Confirmed with odds ratio of 3.3 (CI: 1.21 &#8211; 8.96) in 1,300 Caucasian men.    Confirmed with odds ratio of 7.9 (CI: 1.8 - 34.5, p = .0062) based on 928 Caucasian patients.    G84E not present in 671 Chinese patients or 1,536 controls, but a novel HOXB13 SNP, G135E found by sequencing in 3 of the cases (and no controls).Is rs138213197 also associated with breast cancer risk? Maybe, maybe not - it's too early to tell:    This study of 4,000+ Canadian and Polish patients indicates not; frequency of allele was 0.16%.    Of 877 patients, 6 women with BRCA1/2 wild-type, familial breast cancer (none Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry had the variant, hence an odds ratio 5.7 (CI: 1-40, p=0.02).Additional studies examining the origin of the G84E variant have determined that the haplotype background it is seen within is observed most frequently in Nordic countries, most strikingly within the Finnish population, suggesting that rs138213197 is a founder mutation that arose around the year 1800 in Northern Europe.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4715">According to David Hinds of 23andMe on community forums, "nearly everyone (99.97%) is getting called as CC, and there is no clear heterozygote cluster" ... "the genotype calls for rs25531 on our platform are not meaningful." Looking at OpenSNP frequency data, this seems to be universal for direct to consumer genotyping services at this stage.The minor allele (G) of rs25531 is almost always in phase with the long (L) allele of the 5-HTTLPR, which is the most commonly studied variation in this region. The (L) long allele may be associated with lower levels of serotonin.The article and video from "The Atlantic" suggests that children with the short allele (A), may need and benefit greatly from more maternal support  contrast to earlier reports linking rs25531, a SNP in the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 gene, to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), a March 2007 publication finds no significant association studying "the largest sample size of OCD patients (N=347) and controls (N=749) ever investigated". A separate study of 75 patients suffering mood disorders after traumatic brain injury (TBI) concluded that there was no evidence of association between rs25531 and depression post-TBI.A small study (62 patients and 62 matched controls) investigated this SNP in relation to blushing. (Blushing is considered to be one of the prime pathophysiological markers of social anxiety disorder.) The less active 5-HTTLPR genotypes were nominally significantly associated with increased blushing propensity in patients with social anxiety disorder, and association remained significant even when statistically controlled for he influence of depression.A study of 94 depressed patients who attempted suicide compared to 94 without psychiatric disorders found no evidence of an association with rs25531.A study of 97 "normal" individuals concluded that rs25531(G;G) individuals selectively process positive affective material alongside selective avoidance of negative affective material, in a manner absent among individuals carrying a rs25531(A) allele. To put it another way, if this conclusion drawn from a very small sample of people can be replicated, rs25531(G;G) individuals may have a tendency to be optimists and to be more resilient to stress.A study published in 2011 of 2,500+ individuals followed from 1995 - 2008 as part of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health found that twice as many respondents with two 5-HTTLPR long variants said they were very satisfied with life compared with carriers of two short versions. Conversely, 26% of those carrying two short alleles said they were dissatisfied with life, compared with 20% of people carrying two long variants. This  blog post investigates the statistics.A study of 135 patients with major depressive disorder (mean age 31.1+/-11.6 years, 68% females) treated with escitalopram 10-20 mg/day for 12 weeks concluded that patients carrying the rs25531(A) allele may be at increased risk for side effects (e.g. headaches), but they say no associations with efficacy.

The risk allele (encoding the arginine at position 719) is rs20455(C).An extensive 2010 meta-analysis, including over 17,000 patients, suggests this variant does not significantly influence coronary artery disease risk.This SNP is one of the 5 used by Celera's genetic risk score (GRS) for coronary heart disease (CHD).  rs20455, in the KIF6 gene rs3900940, in the MYH15 gene rs7439293, in the PALLD gene rs2298566, in the SNX19 gene rs1010, in the VAMP8 geneFor each of the five variants, the GRS was increased by 1 if the subject was homozygous for the risk variant, unchanged if heterozygous, and decreased by 1 if the individual did not carry the variant. Therefore, individuals carrying all 10 possible risk variants (two copies of each of the five SNPs) were assigned a GRS of 5 and those carrying no risk variants a GRS of -5. A high GRS was defined as 3 or higher. Approximately 4% of the white cohort in ARIC was classified as high risk, and the hazard ratio for CHD after adjustment for traditional risk factors was a significant 1.57 (CI: 1.21-2.04; p<0.001). The results did not reproduce for African American participants. Carriers of the 719Arg allele of KIF6 have 34% higher risk of myocardial infarction and 24% higher risk of coronary heart disease compared with noncarriers among 25,283 women. Carriers of 719Arg receive significantly greater benefit from intensive statin therapy than do noncarriers. The benefit from intensive (compared with moderate) statin therapy was significantly greater in the 59% of the 1,778 patients who were carriers (hazard ratio 0.59, CI: 0.45 -0.77) than in those who were noncarriers (HR 0.94, CI: 0.70-1.27; p=0.018 for interaction between 719Arg carrier status and treatment). The absolute risk reduction was 10.0% in carriers versus 0.8% in noncarriers. Untreated carriers of the rs20455 risk allele had odds ratios for MI or stroke of 1.50 and 1.55 (CI: 1.05-2.15 or 1.14-2.09) in two large clinical trials. Among treated carriers, the absolute risk reduction by pravastatin therapy was 4.9% and 5.5% (CI: 1.81-7.9% or 3.5-7.5%). Therefore, in both trials carriers of a rs20455(C) SNP had an increased risk of coronary events, and statin treatment (in this case, pravastatin) reduced that risk more for such carriers than for noncarriers. Elderly carriers of a rs20455(C) (719Arg) allele with prior vascular disease received significant benefit from pravastatin; however, no benefit was observed in noncarriers with prior disease or in those without prior disease (carriers or noncarriers). Across all ethnic groups studied, pravastatin therapy significantly and substantially reduced both fatal coronary events and nonfatal myocardial infarctions only for carriers of the 719Arg allele (and not for noncarriers).</p>

Further confirmed PMID 18207215, PMID 18206206. The genotype at highest risk is (A;A).Note, most studies have shown that that this SNP is highly predictive (i.e. is in near perfect (D'>0.98) linkage disequilibrium) with rs10490924, thus the status of one very closely predicts the status of the other.  However, one Caucasian AMD study reported the linkage disequilibrium measure for these two SNPs on 10q26, (i.e., rs10490924, which is upstream of HTRA1 in LOC387715/ARMS2, and rs11200638) as D'=0.8, and all four possible haplotypes of the two SNPs were detected in the samples.  Further, this same study reported that these two SNPs appear to contribute equally to the risk of AMD (both GA and CNV) and show no evidence of interaction with CFH .A 2011 meta-analysis concluded that rs11200638(A;G) and (A;A) carriers had 2.243 and 8.669 times the risk of developing AMD, respectively, when compared with those who carry the (G;G) genotype. rs10490924 and rs11200638 defined 2 significant haplotypes associated with increased risk of neovascular AMD. show that rs11200638 has no significant impact on HTRA1 promoter activity in three different cell lines, and HTRA1 mRNA expression exhibits no significant change between control and AMD retinas A study of 95 Taiwanese Chinese confirms rs11200638(A) allele risk for both wet and dry forms of AMD, with heterozygote odds ratio of 1.97 CI:0.81-4.81, homozygote OR = 8.59 CI: 3.28-22.49, p=6.7x10<sup>-3</sup> for an additive allele-dosage model. A study of Chinese AMD patients reports a 7.6x increased risk for rs11200638(A), and finds that smoking almost doubles the risk, to 15.7x increased risk.

Four polymorphisms, considered separately, had ODs over 1.3, but p values were not strong, between 0.003 and 0.12.

(Tables 3,4) Adding significance for the exon 33 SNP in particular, they discovered "an interaction between HLA-DR3 and the exon 33 SNP, giving an odds ratio of 6.1 for Graves' disease." However, one must keep in mind the small sample size of this study. In addition, this study focused on a Caucasian sample, while some other studies have focused on Chinese samples.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2274">This SNP is associated with osteoarthritis (OA). It is located in the ''five prime untranslated region'' (| '''5&#8242;UTR''') of the gene encoding ''growth differentiation factor 5'' (| '''GDF5'''), a chondrogenic protein active from the embryonic stage onwards. GDF5 is also known as ''cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein 1'' or ''BMP14''. The '''risk allele T''' (+ 104T/C;rs143383) causes reduction of the GDF5 promoter sequence activity. Reduction of GDF5 in human cartilage of patients with OA by up to 27% has been observed . This effect is '''influenced by a second SNP ( rs143384 , C/T )''' in the same area. The C alleles of both SNPs form CpG dinucleotides. Demethylation of both SNP's increases GDF5 expression.  Thus the authors conclude that epigenetic manipulation offers options in developing therapies for OA. rs143383 showed significant association with hip osteoarthritis in two independent Japanese populations. It also showed association with knee osteoarthritis in Japanese and Chinese populations. is  not  a risk factor for osteoarthritis in Greek CaucasiansA subsequent study showed that the same risk allele, rs143383(T), was (somewhat) associated with osteoarthritis in European populations. The odds ratio was 1.10 for the allele, 1.28 for carrier status (p=0.03, p=0.004, respectively). The (T) allele appears to make less GDF5 protein, which eventually renders an individual somewhat more susceptible to osteoarthritis.A meta-analysis combining data from 11,000+ individuals as well as both European and Asian populations found strong evidence (p < 0.0004) confirming increased risk for osteoarthritis from the rs143383(T) allele. The best model is a dominant one, and the odds ratio reported is 1.21 in general and 1.48 for the dominant model.Another meta-analysis of 14 studies concluded that rs143383 did indeed show significant association with osteoarthritis, at least for knee osteoarthritis, and probably for hand and hip (but to a lesser degree). The effect size wasn't large, though (odds ratio 1.15, CI: 1.09-1.22, p = 9.4 x 10e-7).A haplotype of rs143383 and rs6060369 can be defined, which also links osteoarthritis to height since rs6060369 was linked to height in a study ultimately involving over 28,000 individuals.The  Medpage article on this finding notes that rs143383 was previously shown to be associated with increased risk for osteoarthritis and in this recent study  it was significantly associated with shorter height in the initial scans, at p=2.70x10e-5.Note that the authors of  refer to rs143383 in the opposite orientation compared to it's entry in dbSNP.  A study of 338 Han Chinese children affected by congenital dysplasia of the hip revealed that rs143383(T) alleles conferred a 1.4x increased risk for the disorder, particularly in females (odds ratio 1.43, CI: 1.11 - 1.85, p = 0.0078). A study of 6,365 elderly Caucasian men and women observed significant association between rs143383 and osteoarthritis, height, bone size and fracture risk in women.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1613">. Published 2009. This study analyzed polymorphisms of SNPs rs12885300 (called "(ORFa)-Gly3Asp") and rs225014 (called "Thr92Ala") in relation to DIO2 gene activity in BPAD (Bipolar disorder) patients in China. Findings in abstract: "Both SNPs were significantly higher in the BPAD patients, with odds ratios of 1.489 ... and 1.616 ... respectively. Individuals with two copies of the variant 3Gly or 92Ala were at greater risk of BPAD.... Haplotypes ORFa-3Asp-92Ala and ORFa-3Gly-92Ala indicated higher susceptibility for BPAD with odds ratios of 3.759 (95% CI=2.013-7.020) and 1.292 (95% CI=1.017-1.642), respectively, while ORFa-3Asp-92Thr probably played a protective role with an odds ratio of 0.395 (95% CI=0.284-0.549)." (Abstract). A 2008 article titled "Identification of DIO2 as a new susceptibility locus for symptomatic osteoarthritis" explained that "Confirmation and replication by association in the additional osteoarthritis studies indicated a common DIO2 haplotype, exclusively containing the minor allele of rs225014 and common allele of rs12885300, with a combined recessive odds ratio of 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-2.34 with P = 2.02 x 10(-5) in female cases with advanced/symptomatic hip osteoarthritis." (Abstract). This 2011 study examined various shapes of hip joints in relation to osteoarthritis (OA) risk alleles. They "observed a significant interaction between carrier status of DIO2 rs12885300 and hip OA characteristics for mode 1 (shown in Figure 1) (P = 0.005). ... This specific aspect of hip shape correlates with OA characteristics only in carriers of the susceptibility allele." (Abstract) The -258A/G (SNP rs12885300) polymorphism of the human type 2 deiodinase gene is associated with a shift in the pattern of secretion of thyroid hormones following a TRH-induced acute rise in TSH.. After thyroidectomy, high doses of L-T4 are used to suppress TSH. Since no T3 is being produced by the thyroid, the body depends on D1 and D2 enzymes to convert T4 into the active T3. This study collected 1905 serum samples from 151 patients over 8.8 to 11.5 years and analyzed four SNPs: DIO1-rs11206244 (D1-C785T) DIO1-rs12095080 (D1-A1814G)  DIO2-rs225014 (D2-Thr92Ala) DIO2-rs12885300 (D2-ORFa-Gly3Asp). Their data "suggest that the negative feedback of FT(4) on TSH is weaker in patients homozygous for the D2-rs12885300 T allele than in wild-type and heterozygous subjects." These patients "have an altered set point of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis." However, they noted that their data depended on TSH and T4 levels alone, since T3 and rT3 were measured at only one time point during the study. A common variation in deiodinase 1 gene DIO1 is associated with the relative levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine. (Published 2008). Attempted to study rs12885300 but this SNP failed quality control due to duplicate errors and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The study found significant effects with variants of another DIO1 SNP, rs2235544.See further discussion of this DIO2 gene's other SNP : rs225014</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4001">The snp is suspected of being somewhat confused as an ambiguous flip, because the ReferenceAllele of T has a HapMap freq of 15% in CEU. Also notable is that dbSNP shows RefSNP Alleles:A/C/G/T, and other bits that don't quite fit. While the text below is still of use, it is likely that some of the conclusions are reversed.rs854560, also known as L55M, is a SNP in the PON1 gene.  It codes for amino acid 55 (or 54, depending on the numbering) of the paraoxonase (PON) protein.  Variants of this SNP affect levels of PON protein and mRNA and are correlated with Heart disease, aspects of Diabetes including diabetic retinopathy, and trait-anxiety scores.  The apparently more favorable form, rs854560(T), encodes a methionine and lead to elevated levels of paraoxonase, which is generally a good thing. The variant, rs854560(A), encodes an leucine, leading to less paraoxonase activity.   '''Note:''' These alleles are typically reported in the context of the mRNA sense orientation, where the (A) encodes the methionine, and the (T) encodes the leucine. rs854560 as published in dbSNP is from the opposite strand and thus the allele designation is reversed compared to the literature. Frequency of rs854560(A) allele, and of rs854560(A,A) genotype, appears to increase incidence of diabetic retinopathy. rs854560(A;A) genotype predicts higher insulin resistance, bodyweight, triglyceride levels, and blood pressure, and therefore cardiovascular risk. rs854560(A) associated with increased common carotid artery intima-media thickness compared to rs854560(T) (p value for trend 0.03), suggesting that variation in the PON1 gene contributes to early atherosclerosis in children with familial hypercholesterolemia. 274 ovarian epithelial carcinoma cases and 452 controls. rs854560 odds ratio 0.53 (CI: 0.35-0.79; p for allele-dose effect = 0.01) for women carrying the rs854560(T) allele compared with women with the (A;A) genotype rs854560(A;A) homozygotes experienced a significant increase, while rs854560(T) carriers experienced a non-significant decrease in HDL-Lp-PLA(2) activity (p = 0.030 between groups), upon fluvastatin treatment for 6 months; this may have implications for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In a study of 461 participants in the HERITAGE cohort (172 African-American, 289 Caucasian), the combination of rs854560 (L55M or PON55) with rs662 (Q192R or PON192) were found to significantly contribute to trait-anxiety scores.  The authors also cite another paper, , which found that the atypical version of this SNP reduces PON protein and mRNA levels.  Which genotypes correlate with increased trait-anxiety scores and/or reduced PON levels is unclear.  This paper states that the typical "L" version is TTG, and the "M" substitution is ATG.  This may help clear up the ambiguous flip if neighboring base pair information were available from the other sources as well. No association between rs854560 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was seen in this large meta-analysis.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2094">rs1050828, also known as c.292G>A, p.Val98Met and V98M as well as the G6PD A- mutation, is a SNP residing in the G6PD gene and is located the X chromosome. G6PD codes for the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which helps protect the cell from oxidative damage. Depending on genotype, an individual may possess one or two primary versions of the G6PD gene; type A and type B. Type A is predominantly found in people who have African ancestry. Mutations of G6PD can cause varying degrees of G6PD deficiency, which is a disease affecting red blood cells. For example, an G to A substitution mutation at the rs1050828 (also referred to as G202A) is associated with a reduction of G6PD.  The G6PD deficient genotype A- (~8-20% reduction of G6PD) is typically defined by the possession of the rs1050828 A allele (rs1050828(A;A)).  In addition, individuals who are type A- almost always possess the rs1050829 G allele. G6PD deficiency frequency is highest in malarial regions where G6PD deficient individuals are typically less affected by malarial infection ().  Also, the literature suggests that there is association between the rs1050828 locus and various red blood cell traits in African Americans.A 2019 publication reports that this variant also has the effect of lowering HbA1c values by ~0.88%-units in hemizygous men and 0.34%-units in heterozygous women. The authors suggest that when using Hb1Ac values to diagnose type-2 diabetes, those units should be added to the measured Hb1Ac level, and a diagnosis should then be made if the sum is >6.5% (the standard diagnostic threshold).   A total of 72 SNPs were genotyped in two populations in eastern Sudan (Hausa and Massalit), as well as, a cohort of malaria hospital patients and a control sample set (n=449).  The study found that in comparison to controls (n=69), Massalit individuals (n=60) who possess the rs105828 A allele were less susceptible to malarial infection (P=0.04). Study surveyed 49,094 SNPs (covering ~2,100 candidate genes)in Caucasian (n=23,439) and African American (n=7,112) individuals from five different population cohorts.  Genome wide association results include that rs1050828 A allele found in African American individuals is strongly associated with certain erythrocyte phenotypes including; lower red blood cell, hemoglobin and hematocrit counts (all p values <2.0 x 10 <sup>-13</sup>). In order to identify SNPs associated with different red blood cell phenotypic traits a genome-wide association study was conducted on African Americans (n=16,500). The SNP rs1050828 was found to be associated with hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and RBC count. A cohort of African American medical patients (n=1904) was analyzed in a genome-wide association study where loci were correlated with certain red blood cell traits.  The rs1050828 locus is associated with RBC count (P=4x10<sup>-13</sup>), mean corpuscular volume (P=1x10<sup>-14</sup>), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (P=9x10<sup>-9</sup>).</p>

Carriers of the rs2004640T slightly increased among SLE patients (58.8%) as compared with controls (50.2%). When data from our Japanese population were combined with previously published data from a Korean population, the T allele frequency was found to be significantly increased in SLE patients (P = 8.3 x 10(-5)). While no association was observed for the rs10954213 . significant associations with 3 intron 1 SNPs (-4001, rs6953165, and rs41298401) were found. The allele frequency of rs41298401G was significantly decreased in SLE patients (13.0% versus 18.7% in controls; P = 0.017), and the allele frequency of rs6953165G, which was in absolute linkage disequilibrium with -4001A, was increased in SLE patients (8.8% versus 5.2% in controls; P = 0.034). The Caucasian risk haplotype was not present; instead, a protective haplotype carrying rs2004640G, rs41298401G, the deletion in exon 6, and rs10954213A was identified. SNP rs10954213 A variant located 64 bp upstream of the first untranslated exon (exon 1A), consisting of a 5 bp insertion/deletion CGGGG, may be the causative SNP in this region that is most responsible for increasing SLE risk, the rs# for the CGGGG insertion/deletion is rs77571059.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="862">'''rs2281845''' is a SNP located on chromosome 1q32.1, about 250 bp upstream of the first exon of the CACNA1S (voltage-dependent calcium channel, L type)gene. The linkage disequilibrium block containing rs2281845 extends 22 kb downstream and includes the TMEM9 gene (transmembrane protein 9). This SNP has been clinically  associated with tooth development. The minor allele (T) has specifically been associated with reduced mature dentition between the ages of 6 and 14 in women. In a 2011 report, a genome-wide quantitative trait association study conducted with 521,741 SNPs over 5,097 women from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) found a significant (p-value=1.31E-10) association between the rs2281845 T allele and a reduction in permanent teeth erupted (-0.105) between ages 6 and 14. To confirm this finding, an additional 3,696 individuals were also tested for this association. These subjects were drawn from three additional Danish cohorts, as well as one from the United States. The association was replicated in each of the Danish cohorts (p-values=5.43E-05, 1.09E-04, and 0.012, respectively), but the group from the United States exhibited a weak association (p-value=0.242) in the opposite direction (+0.065 teeth). This contradictory finding was attributed to small sample size and deficiencies in phenotype reporting. The original GWAS and replication datasets, when combined for a total of 8,793 subjects, showed a statistically significant (p-value=8.03E-17) negative association with number of permanent teeth (-0.103). Within the same study, three additional SNPs were identified in the initial DNBC cohort GWAS as having a significant association with number of permanent teeth between ages 6 and 14. These SNPs &#8211; rs12424086, rs4491709, rs7924176 &#8211; were each validated to statistical significance with a replication set (p-values=2.30E-12, 2.16E-14, and 5.64E-19, respectively). No loci aside from those containing these four SNPs exhibited a p-value of less than 5.0E-6. Each of these SNPs that were identified in the context of dental development may be confounded by associations with generalized maturation programs. The authors note that while the phenotype of mature teeth was measured here, the SNPs could in fact correlate better with measures of puberty such as &#8220;skeletal maturation, Tanner score and growth spurt,&#8221; with number of mature teeth simply as a manifestation of these other phenotypes. Mechanistically, rs2281845&#8217;s effect on tooth development may be linked to expression of TMEM9. In a study linking SNPs to gene expression in monocytes, several variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs2281845 were found to be significantly associated with TMEM9 expression. The SNP with highest linkage to rs2281845, rs6667912 (r2=0.42) showed a significant association (p-value=6x10E-29). Little is known regarding the function of TMEM9. It is a well-conserved, 26kDa transmembrane protein with expression throughout a wide variety of human tissues and cells. An &#8216;&#8216;in vitro&#8217;&#8217; study showed localization to the ER, late endosomes, and lysosomes along with  LAMP1 coexpression, but its function within the cell is not yet well-characterized.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3030">rs3825942, also known as G153D, a SNP causing an amino acid change in the lysyl oxidase 1 LOXL1 gene, has been linked to exfoliation glaucoma (also known as exfoliation syndrome). This form of glaucoma causes up to 10% of the cases of blindness in many countries, including the US.  From the abstract of this study: "Approximately 25% of the general population is homozygous for the highest risk haplotype C;C here combined with other risk SNPs and their risk of suffering XFG (exfoliation glaucoma) is over 100 times that of those only carrying low-risk haplotypes."The risk allele for this SNP is rs3825942(C), as oriented with respect to the dbSNP entry, and it confers a estimated relative risk (by itself) of 27 compared to the (T) allele. The odds ratio is 20.10 (CI 10.80-37.41). Note that the (C) allele is actually quite common in most European populations.A meta-analysis including 24 articles across 5 ethnicities (Caucasian, African, Japanese, Indian, and Chinese) concluded that rs3825942 is the common disease-associated SNP in all populations, whereas rs1048661 and rs2165241 were inconsistent. The odds ratio is approximately 10 for rs3825942(C;C), while the heterozygote rs3825942(C;T) was not statistically significant. rs3825942 was not associated with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).With so many people at high risk, shouldn't the number of cases be much higher? Not necessarily, since glaucoma risk only becomes high in ageing|older individuals. To put it another way: plenty of folks don't live long enough to find out if they would have gotten glaucoma. The estimate for glaucoma incidence worldwide is 10-20% only for individuals over 60 years of age; in Iceland, where glaucoma incidence is high, 40% of individuals 80 or older show signs of exfoliation ''syndrome'', which has been seen to convert to exfolation ''glaucoma'' at a rate of 60% - over a 15 year period. PMID 12928689, PMID 10463402, PMID 17224761discussed in this / blog post rs1048661 (G), rs3825942 (C), and rs2165241 (T) are highly associated with XFS and XFG in American and European populations. The GGT haplotype constitutes a major risk haplotype for exfoliation. Confirmed as risk for pseudoexfoliation (PEX) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG) in populations of German and Italian descent. Although not conducted with a large number of patients, in a study of black South Africans the rs3825942(T) allele was the risk allele, in contrast to other populations.{PMID Auto|PMID=22065931|Title=Decreased total antioxidants status in the plasma of patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma.}}<!-- see the talk pageAn anonymous user points out at the risk allele is the reference. This is a 'error' in clinvar, but I believe it is the reason this one is flagged as |CLNSIG=255Ideally this would be fixed upstream, and a change here might eventually be overwritten by a bot (hence the need for this comment). I could also introduce a new flag which explicitly flags the bad geno, and while defaulting to the current behavior.--></p>

The rs17576(G) allele encodes the Arg (R).In a study of 385 male veterans with greater than 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking, rs17576(G) allele carriers were at higher risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The rs17576(G;G) homozygous genotype was at 3-fold increased risk for COPD.A study of 744 Chinese patients with lung cancer found that the rs17576(G;G) genotype was associated with higher risk of lung cancer with metastasis (adjusted OR, 1.79, CI: 1.03-3.08) compared to the (A;A) genotype.rs17576 is also one of two SNPs in the MMP9 gene associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction, but not coronary artery disease.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5111">This SNP, a variant in the TP53 gene, is 1 of 25 SNPs reported to represent independently minor, but cumulatively significant, increased risk for breast cancer. For details of all 25 SNPs in this group, along with the two methods used to calculate overall risk estimates for breast cancer, refer to the SNPedia breast cancer entry.For this particular SNP, as oriented in dbSNP and to the gene, the less common G allele encodes an arginine at position 72 of the protein (where there's normally a proline), and the SNP is commonly called the Arg72 variant, although P72R and Arg72Pro are also common in the literature. Minor allele homozygotes, i.e. rs1042522(C;C) genotypes, live on average 3 years longer than major allele (G;G) homozygotes, based on a study of 9,200+ Danish individuals. The increased longevity is speculated to be related to the increased apoptosis seen for this gain of function SNP, presumably due to "increased robustness" during the period of treatment after the diagnosis of life-threatening diseases such as cancer of certain types.A study of 148 individuals with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) concluded rs1042522(G;G) genotypes were more likely to be resistant to first-line chemotherapy, especially the irinotecan plus cisplatin regimen, than those with (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes (60% vs 27%, p = .014). In multivariate analysis, the (G;G) genotype was strongly predictive for shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio HR = 1.952, p = .01).A study of 57 patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy found that rs1042522(G;G) and rs1042522(C;G) genotypes were significantly correlated with a lower response rate (and worse progression) to the combination chemotherapy when compared to rs1042522(C;C) homozygotes (35.7 vs. 66.7%, p-value 0.019).rs1042522 is not associated with SLE in a study of Caucasians, African-Americans, and Asian children and adults.Implicated in type-2 diabetes based on a study of 1,161 Finnish patients.  rs2279744, rs1042522, rs17878362 and rs1625895 associated with high grade endometrial cancer/ 23andMe blog African Americans with rs1042522(G;G) in the p53 gene were 2.15 times more likely to die of colorectal cancer than those with one or no copies of a G at this SNP.  In Caucasians there was no association between survival and rs1042522./ 23andMe blog rs1042522(C) might have had an easier time conceiving in colder temperatures The P72 allele was found to be significantly enriched over the R72 allele among in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients. The P72 allele serves as a risk factor for implantation failure. LIF levels are significantly lower in cells with the P72 allele than in cells with the R72 allele, which may contribute to the decreased implantation and fertility associated with the P72 allele. Patients with variant TP53 genotypes either for the Arg72Pro or the PIN3 polymorphism were at increased risk of telangiectasia, a late skin side effect of radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery. Odds ratios were 1.66 for 72Pro carriers and 1.95 for PIN3 A2 allele carriers. Carrying both variant alleles led to a doubling of risk.</p>

Note: this is one of two SNPs within the TCF7L2 gene that have been reported to be associated with type-2 diabetes, the other being rs4506565. They have approximately equal power to estimate risk for type-2 diabetes, and the results from one correlate 92% of the time with the other.

TCF7L2 polymorphisms and progression to diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program. reconfirmed in a diverse population Associated in a study of ~1000 Hispanic-Americans with reduced insulin secretion as measured by acute insulin response and adjusted for the degree of insulin sensitivity (p = 0.032). the CT/TT genotypes strongly predicted future type-2 diabetes. The risk T allele was associated with impaired insulin secretion, incretin effects, and enhanced rate of hepatic glucose production. TCF7L2 expression in human islets was increased 5-fold in T2D, particularly in carriers of the TT genotype.This SNP is one of 4 relatively common SNPs reported to represent risk for type-2 diabetes in the DESIR prospective study of 3,877 Caucasian participants. Under an additive model, the odds ratio for the (T) risk allele is 1.45 (CI: 1.2-1.77, p=0.0002). For the 4 SNPs, each risk allele increased type-2 diabetes risk by 1.34x (p=2x10e-6), with an odds ratio of 2.48 (CI: 1.59-3.86) for carriers of 4 or more compared to those with one or none (risk alleles).Contrary to what's been seen in most populations studied so far, the association between rs7903146 and type-2 diabetes apparently does not hold in Arab populations, based on a case-control study of 522 Saudi patients and 346 controls.A HuGE review and meta-analysis including over 35,000 type-2 diabetes cases and 39,000 controls concluded that the Bayesian odds ratio for rs7903146(T;T) homozygotes and (C;T) heterozygotes versus (C;C) homozygotes was 1.968 (95% credible interval (CrI): 1.790 - 2.157) and 1.406 (95% CrI: 1.341 - 1.476), respectively, and the population attributable risk (PAR) for the (C;T)/(T;T) genotypes of this variant is 16.9% overall. Along with 3 other TCF7L2 SNPs, a multiplicative genetic model was indicated.A study of over 13,000 individuals initially free of cancer and followed over 10+ years found that the rs7903146(T) allele was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer, with an adjusted odds ratio of  1.25 (CI:0.85-1.83) and 2.15 (CI:1.27-3.64) for the (C;T) and (T;T) genotypes, respectively.Does the association with type 2 diabetes hold for youth as well as for ageing|adults?

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3205">Rs2237717 (major: C, minor: T) is located in intron 11 within the MET proto-oncogene. The MET gene is primarily known to be involved in tumor metastasis . However, MET has also been shown to have roles in general neurodevelopment  and in the development of autism .  Rs2237717 has been linked to schizophrenia, ability to recognize facial emotion, and chronic rhinosinusitis. ==Association with schizophrenia and cognitive ability== Given that schizophrenic patients have a lower incidence of cancer despite more exposure to risk factors and relatives without schizophrenia appear to also have a protective effect on cancer incidence, it has been hypothesized that alterations in cancer genes (like MET, containing rs2237717) may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia . ===Schizophrenia===In a study by Burdick et al  which investigated the relation between SNPs in MET gene and schizophrenia, it was found that rs2237717 resided in an enriched haplotype of one of the four haplotype blocks. The &#8216;Block 3&#8217; haplotype was the most commonly underrepresented in the schizophrenia case group (p = 2.5e-4, OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24&#8212;0.65). Rs2237717 was one of three SNPs in the haplotype block to survive correction with permutation (p = 0.002), with 37.9% of the cases and 49.6% of the controls showing the ancestral allele (C). The ancestral allele is thus considered a protective allele against schizophrenia. This test was replicated by the authors using a dominant model and the results remained significant (p = 0.001). These results represent the first report of an association between MET and schizophrenia and the second of an association of MET with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric illness (autism, . ===General cognitive ability===They also reported that the MET haplotype which was inversely correlated with schizophrenia (&#8216;Block 3&#8217; containing rs2237717) had a significant impact on neurocognition. Carriers of the major allele at rs2237717 in the comparison group performed significantly better than non-carriers on a test of general cognitive ability.==Association with facial emotional perception==Another study by Lin et al  showed the rs2237717 SNP is associated with facial emotional perception.  The CT and CC genotypes enhanced facial emotional perception as compared to those with the TT genotype (ANOVA p = 0.016 and GLM p = 0.018, controlled for age, gender, and education). There was also an interaction of rs2237717 with rs1130233 in the AKT gene in the same signaling pathway, in which the rs2237717 C carrier/ rs1130233 G carrier group showed better facial emotional perception than those with the TT/AA genotype (ANOVA p = 0.035 and GLM p = 0.015), controlled for neurocognitive functions. According to the authors, this is the first study to suggest that genetic factors can affect performance of facial emotion perception.==Association with chronic rhinosinusitis==The MET gene has been implicated in nasal polyp development , and Castano et al  showed that the minor allele at rs2237717 is associated with chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with nasal polyps (genotypic P nominal = 0.09, empirical P = 0.04, OR = 1.4, CI = 1.0-1.9). This suggests that polymorphisms in the MET gene, including rs2237717, may play a role in the susceptibility to develop CRS. Study findings apply to patients with nasal polyps and severe CRS unresponsive to surgery.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2840">The SNP is located in an intron of ''ITIH3'', a domain of a protease inhibitor. rs2535629 was recently shown to be significantly associated with multiple mental disorders: autism-spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia, where A is the risk allele.  However, the causative gene has not yet been determined since the SNP is in linkage disequilibrium with more than 30 genes in the surrounding 1Mb region.===Symptom-based diagnosis===Mental disorders are currently classified based on symptoms and the course of the disease, as specified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). However, presentation of diseases as classified by DSM is highly heterogeneous. As genomic data is becoming more abundant, the possibility of diagnosis based on the underlying molecular cause is being discussed.===Familial mental disorders===It has long been known that relatives of mental health patients have a higher chance of having a psychiatric illness, but not necessarily the same illness as the patient.     This has led to the idea that common genetic factors underlie multiple psychiatric disorders. A GWAS carried out by Smoller ''et al'' identified three SNPs predictive of autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia &#8211; rs2535629, rs11191454, and rs2799573 &#8211; and one predictive of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia only &#8211; rs1024582. ===Implicating study===The study analyzed 33332 cases and 27888 controls, where patients were of European descent and met criteria from DSM-III revised or DSM-IV.  1,250,922 autosomal SNPs were examined.The study divided patients and controls into five groups:  Autism-spectrum disorders (4788 trio cases (two parents and an affected offspring who inherited the allele in question), 4788 trio pseudocontrols (two parents and an offspring who did not inherit the allele in question), 161 cases and 526 controls);  Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (1947 trio cases, 1947 trio pseudocontrols, 840 cases, 688 controls);  Bipolar disorder (6990 cases, 4820 controls);  Major depressive disorder (9227 cases, 7383 controls);  Schizophrenia (9379 cases, 7736 controls)rs2535629 has been shown to be predictive of the five disorders above with a combined odds ratio 1.10, p-value 2.54 10<sup>-12</sup>. For a complex disorder like any of the five illnesses above, odds ratio of 1.10 suggests an important genetic locus, while the p-value above indicates strong confidence in the result.===Corroborating Studies=======Bipolar Disorder====A study by the Scott ''et al'' identified rs1042779 as a predictor of bipolar disorder.  rs1042779 is 12kb away from rs2535629, but within the rs2535629 1Mb haplotype. The odds ratio of rs1042779 was 1.19, with p-value 1.8 10<sup>-7</sup>. The study included 3944 patients with bipolar disorder I and II diagnosed based on DSM-III or DSM-IV and 14507 controls. All subjects were of European ancestry.====Major Depressive and Bipolar Disorder====Another study identified rs2251219, a SNP 248kb away from rs2535629, but within the 1Mb haplotype, as significantly associated with bipolar disorder and combined major depressive disorder.  The SNP was found to have an odds ratio of 0.87 with p-value 3.63 10<sup>-8</sup>. The study analyzed individuals of European origin, of whom 8765 cases of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder as defined by DSM-IV and 9122 controls.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3998">rs662, also known as Q192R, is a SNP in the PON1 gene.  It codes for amino acid 192 of the paraoxonase (PON) protein.  Variants of this SNP affect PON catalytic efficiency and are correlated with Heart disease and trait-anxiety scores.  The normal form, rs662(A), encodes a glutamine (Q), while the variant, rs662(G), encodes an arginine (R). The general hypothesis is that the glutamine-containing PON1 protein has higher enzymatic activity, leading to lower risk for heart disease.. However, there are publications that clearly report the opposite.Studies finding greater heart disease risk associated with the Q192 (glutamine) form include:  : 2009 study involving 10 year follow up study of 800 patients reporting a hazard ratio of 1.71 (CI:1.0 - 2.8, p=0.03) per Q allele  : 2009 study of ~1400 patients undergoing coronary angiography at the Cleveland Clinic concludes that QQ192 patients have the lowest PON1 activity and have both an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.05; CI: 1.32-3.18) and of major adverse cardiac events (HR 1.48, CI: 1.09-2.03, p = .01). See also this  Table  : 2011 study of with coronary artery disease patients receiving a stent and taking clopidogrel concluded that QQ192 homozygous individuals had the highest risk for stent thrombosis (OR 3.6; p = 0.0003) and that their PON1 plasma activity, active metabolite plasma concentration and platelet inhibition were all lower compared to RR homozygotes.Studies finding greater heart disease risk associated with the R192 (arginine) form include:  : 2010 meta-analysis of 22 eligible studies (totaling 7384 cases/11,074 controls) yields a summary odds ratio for ischemic stroke of 1.10 per G allele (CI: 1.04-1.17)  : 2013 report on ~200 Saudis concludes that the RR genotype was associated with CAD risk (OR 2.2, CI: 1.4-7.4, p < 0.01)  : Perhaps the most striking finding with such an association was reported in Japanese patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). NIDDM patients with either one or two rs662(G) alleles had a 9 fold higher risk of coronary heart disease compared with rs662(A;A) NIDDM patients. 274 ovarian epithelial carcinoma cases and 452 controls. rs662 odds ratio 0.65 (CI: 0.44-0.95; p for allele-dose effect = 0.03) for ovarian cancer for women carrying the rs662(A) allele compared with women with the (G;G) genotype rs1799864(G), rs3025058(A) and rs662(G) were associated with increased risk, and rs1800775(A) with reduced risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism In a study of 461 participants in the HERITAGE cohort (172 African-American, 289 Caucasian), the combination of rs662 with rs854560 was found to significantly contribute to trait-anxiety scores.  The high trait-anxiety group included "significantly more subjects homozygous to the Alzheimer's disease- predictive PON192 variant."  The authors also cite another paper, , which found that this SNP affects PON's catalytic efficiency.  From the context, it appears that it is the "R" variant, or rs662(G), which corresponds to the higher trait-anxiety scores and reduced catalytic efficiency, though this is less explicitly stated than one might hope. No association between rs662 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was seen in this large meta-analysis.</p>

Methadone is a substrate of this protein, so variants may affect the efficacy and optimal dosage of this drug as used for treating opiate dependence.A study of 98 methadone-maintaining patients concluded that the higher (>150 mg/day) and lower (< or =150 mg/day) methadone dose groups differed significantly in their rs1128503 status (experiment-wise p = 0.0325). Furthermore, individuals with the 3-locus genotype pattern (T;T)-(T;T)-(T;T) for SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503, respectively, had an approximately 5-fold chance of requiring the 'higher' methadone dose, while individuals heterozygous for these three SNPs have an approximately 3-fold chance of stabilizing at the 'lower' methadone dose (point-wise p-value = 0.026).

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5157">rs75932628(T), a SNP in the TREM2 gene on chromosome 6 resulting in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significantly higher risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease based on two articles published together in 2013 in the New Engl. J. of Med.In one study, the odds ratio for rs75932628(T) was 2.9 (CI: 2.09 to 4.09, P=3.42&#215;10&#8722;10). The mutation had a frequency of 0.46% in controls 85 years of age or older. The authors also observed the association in additional sample sets (odds ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 2.16 to 3.91; P=2.1&#215;10&#8722;12 in combined discovery and replication samples), and found that carriers of rs75932628-T between the ages of 80 and 100 years without Alzheimer's disease had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers (P=0.003).In the other study, analysis of the rs75932628(T) in a series that included 1887 patients with Alzheimer's disease showed a strong, highly significant association (odds ratio, 5.05, CI: 2.77 to 9.16; P=9.0&#215;10&#8722;9). Four other TREM2 gene variants (D87N, T66M, Y38C, and Q33X) were also associated with higher risk for a frontotemporal dementia&#8211;like syndrome when homozygous.Notably, a 2018 study has raised the possibility that in TREM2 R47H mutation carriers, an APOE4 allele may be required for Alzheimer's to develop.Other studies confirming (or in some cases, refuting) an association between R47H and Alzheimer's include: Data shows that rs75932628 is highly significantly associated with the risk of AD across 24,086 AD cases and 148,993 controls of European descent (OR 2.71, p = 4.67 × 10e-25). Based on a study of ~1,000 Alzheimer patients, the R47H mutation does appear to be a risk factor for AD (OR = 2.19, CI:1.04-4.51, p = .03). Individuals with p.R47H associated AD (n = 12) had significantly earlier symptom onset than individuals with no TREM2 variants (n = 551) (55.2 years vs. 61.7 years (p = .02). Based on a Caucasian population comprising ~1,600 late-onset Alzheimer cases, carriers of the R47H variant are at increased risk (OR 7.40, p = 3.66e-06). A study of 474 AD patients from the northwest region of the UK showed a significant association of the R47H mutation with AD (OR 11.08, CI: 2.55-48.09, and Yates' corrected p value = 0.000146). Meta-analysis of 2 family-based and 5 case-control cohorts yielded an overall summary estimate (using case-control data only) for an odds ratio of 1.67 (CI: 0.95-2.92) for the association between the TREM2 R47H and increased AD risk; so while this study replicates the association, it finds a weaker effect than have other studies. A study of ~3,000 AD patients from Spain did see the R47H association with AD (OR 4.12, CI: 1.21-14.00, p = 0.014). A meta-analysis comprising 32,598 subjects from 4 previous studies demonstrated the large effect of the p.R47H variant in AD risk (OR 4.11, CI: 2.99-5.68, p = 5.27×10e-18). No association was seen between R47H and AD in a study of ~2,000 Japanese patients with late-onset AD.Additional studies include:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4811">The rs4880(T) allele, part of the codon for amino acid valine at codon 16 of the antioxidant protein from the mitochrondrial superoxide dismutase 2 SOD2 gene, is the most common in most populations studied. The rs4880(C) allele gives rise to an alanine at this position is it also known as Val16Ala manganese superoxide dismutase, or A16V. There appears to be some conflict in the literature over the effect of this SNP. Having a valine at codon 16 is said to reduce enzyme activity , and thus lead to increased oxidative stress, yet in at least one study of the actual enzyme levels measured in people, SOD2 activity was 33% higher in (C;T) or (T;T) individuals compared to (C;C) individuals . Regardless of how this resolves, several phenotypic associations have been reported for this SNP, including:  A 10 fold higher risk for heart disease in hereditary hemochromatosis patients with rs4880(T;T) genotypes compared to similar patients with rs4880(C;T) or rs4880(C;C) genotypes.   An increased risk of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) was found in individuals with rs4880(C;C) (OR = 3.07, CI: 1.55-6.05) genotypes. Odds ratios for developing mesothelioma were even higher for patients lacking obvious exposure to asbestos fibers.   Among prostate cancer patients with a rs4880(T;T) genotype, but not the (C;C) genotype, higher iron intake level was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in risk for aggressive forms of the cancer (OR=2.3, CI: 1.0-4.9).  rs4880(C;T) prostate cancer patients being treated by radiation therapy are more likely (8% compared to 0%, p=0.02) to exhibit a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding after irradiation than (C;C) or (T;T) patients, based on a study of 135 patients. The odds for this are worse if the patient also has the rs861539(C;T) genotype (14% vs 1%, p=0.002).  A study of non-Hispanic Caucasians with various types of brain tumors concluded that there was an increased risk of acoustic neuroma (odds ratio 2.0, CI: 1.1-2.7) associated with the alanine-encoding rs4880(C) allele.  rs4880(C) carriers with breast cancer and being treated with cyclophosphamide had worse survival rates (i.e. didn't benefit as much), based on a 2009 study of 248 US and 340 Norwegian patients.    A 2010 US study of ~450 women receiving cyclophosphamide + adjuvant therapy concluded that rs4880(C) carriers suffered slightly less side effects (HR 0.5) but had slightly worse disease-free survival rates (DFS 1.6); no associations were observed among 874 women who were followed without adjuvant therapy    A 2014 Danish meta-analysis plus study of ~300 patients receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy found no association with rs4880(C) genotype    A 2015 study with a relatively small number (~500) of Chinese gastric cancer patients found rs4880(C) carriers who received postoperative platinum and fluorouracil based chemotherapy were somewhat worse off than non-carriers   See also  OMIM 147460.0001  Note: rs1799725 was combined into rs4880 by dbSNPThe C allele of rs4880 appears to be slightly associated with Alzheimer's disease.  rs2758346 rs4880 and rs2855116 association with Alzheimer's disease</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1888">rs1801274 is a SNP in the Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIa, receptor (CD32) FCGR2A gene. rs1801274(C) encodes the arginine (R) allele, with the (T) allele encoding the variant histidine (H). The (H) isoform is considered high-binding to IgG2 and IgG3, while the (R) isoform is considered low-binding. This SNP is known in the literature by many names, including A519C and H131R. What's the importance of this? FcgR isoforms expressed on immune system cells have been linked to the pathogenic consequences triggered by autoantibodies or immune complexes in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as to the efficacy of some immunotherapeutic treatments such as rituximab.Many studies have been published about this FCGR2A SNP, roughly divided by either disorder or treatment as follows:  HIV to AIDS, including susceptibility and progression   In a study of HIV-infected men, those with a FCGR2a CC genotype progressed to a CD4+ cell count of <200/mm3 at a faster rate than individuals with either of the other genotypes (relative hazard = 1.6; p = 0.0001). However, the authors noted that the progression to AIDS was less impacted by this SNP, largely because TT homozygotes had an increased risk of pneumonia as an AIDS-defining illness.   Lymphoma   A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. The AG and AA genotypes of rs1801274 were associated with higher risk of follicular and small lymphocytic lymphomas: 1.26x (95% CI, 1.01-1.56) and 1.41x (95% CI, 1.10-1.81), respectively (P(trend) = 0.006). Hemophilia A  In a case-control study of 85 individuals a more than 3-fold increased risk of inhibitor development was found compared to patients with the RR genotype  Malaria   Based on a study of more than 1,800 individuals in India, rs1801274(T;T) homozgyotes were significantly associated with protection from disease manifestation, with stronger association observed in the malaria non-endemic region.   Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)   A study of 90 Japanese patients with SLE concluded that individuals with rs1801274(C) alleles were at higher risk for the disease. Classifying the reports by immunotherapeutic treatment studied yields the following:  Studies involving cetuximab:   In a study of 39 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab, the rs1801274(T) (ie H) allele was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.055), by perhaps 1-2 months.   Studies involving infliximab:   A study of 91 patients with rheumatoid arthritis found that at week 30 of treatment with infliximab, rs1801274(C;C) homozygotes had a better ACR20 response (RR: 60% and HH-RH: 33.3%; p= 0.035).   Studies involving rituximab:   In a study of 58 Croatian patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rs1801274 did not influence response, event-free or overall survival.   Studies involving 3F8, an anti-GD2 antibody:   In a study of 136 patients with high risk neuroblastoma treated with the anti-GD2 antibody 3F8 plus GM-CSF immunotherapy, the rs1801274(C;C)(ie R/R) genotype was correlated with progression-free survival for the entire cohort (p = .049) and for the subset of patients with no history of prior relapse (p = .023).

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3026">rs1048661, also known as R141L, a SNP causing an amino acid change in the lysyl oxidase 1 LOXL1 gene, has been linked to exfoliation glaucoma. This form of glaucoma causes up to 10% of the cases of blindness in many countries, including the US. Science DOI: 10.1126/science.1146554 From the abstract of this study: "Approximately 25% of the general population is homozygous for the highest risk haplotype and their risk of suffering XFG (exfoliation glaucoma) is over 100 times that of those only carrying low-risk haplotypes."The risk allele for this SNP is rs1048661(G), and it confers a estimated relative risk (by itself) of 3.04. The odds ratio is 2.46 (CI 1.91-3.16). Note that the (G) allele is actually quite common in most European populations.However, a meta-analysis published in 2010 concluded that it's likely that SNPs rs1048661 and rs2165241 are not directly implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma; only the nearby rs3825942 seemed to be the disease-associated SNP.In the original publications, the haplotypes identified as being of highest risk consisted of the combination of two SNPs together, rs1048661(G) and rs3825942(C), oriented with respect to the dbSNP entry. In the two populations studied combined (from Iceland and Sweden), the (G;C) haplotype has an odds ratio of 27.05, and the (T;C) haplotype has an OR of 8.90, relative to the (G;T) haplotype. The (T;T) haplotype is presumed to be at even lower risk than the (G;T) haplotype, but due at least in part to the high frequency of the rs1048661(G) allele, no individuals in this study carried it. In the populations studied, ~25% of all individuals in the population carry two copies of the (G;C), highest risk haplotype.If the risk of carrying two such haplotypes is multiplicative (which isn't known actually), the authors estimate that individuals carrying two copies of the (G;C) high risk haplotype would have 700 times the risk of developing this type of glaucoma compared to individuals carrying two copies of the (G;T) haplotype. Overall, (G;C) individuals are at ~2.5 fold higher risk than the average person in the populations studied.With so many people at high risk, shouldn't the number of cases be much higher? Not necessarily, since glaucoma risk only becomes high in older individuals. To put it another way: plenty of folks don't live long enough to find out if they would have gotten glaucoma. The estimate for glaucoma incidence worldwide is 10-20% only for individuals over 60 years of age; in Iceland, where glaucoma incidence is high, 40% of individuals 80 or older show signs of exfoliation ''syndrome'', which has been seen to convert to exfolation ''glaucoma'' at a rate of 60% - over a 15 year period. PMID 12928689, PMID 10463402, PMID 17224761Discussed in this / blog post Confirmed as risk for pseudoexfoliation (PEX) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG) in populations of German and Italian descent. rs1048661 (G), rs3825942 (G), and rs2165241 (T) are highly associated with XFS and XFG in American and European populations. The GGT haplotype constitutes a major risk haplotype for exfoliation.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2004">rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the "Fat Gene" . The original paper describing it is here .2015 research suggests rs1421085 may be the causal snp. The researchers identified 10 different FTO SNPs in the first intron of the gene that associated with both BMI and type-2 diabetes. Because they all correlated with each other, they chose to examine one of the SNPs (rs9939609) in detail.rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects. Furthermore, the minor allele frequency was much lower in Chinese populations compared to populations of European descent.  Note: The three FTO SNPs, rs1421085, rs17817449, and rs9939609, are in strong linkage disequilibrium (pairwise r<sup>2</sup>>0.97), and there are two primary haplotypes, C-G-A (42.0 %) and T-T-T (55.5 %). 1,638 type 2 diabetes patients and 1,858 controls rs9939609 in FTO (OR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.25, p = 0.006) A study of 3,000+ UK children indicated that (A;A) genotypes were less satieted (i.e. had greater appetite) than other genotypes, indicating this risk allele for obesity is likely to influence appetite. This SNP is also associated with (severe) obesity in a study of 927 Japanese patients. This SNP may contribute to variation in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels independently of obesity; average CRP levels may be 12-14% higher per rs9939609(A) allele. This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.  A longitudinal study of Finnish children concluded that the effect of rs9939609 on BMI only becomes evident after age 7, and that the FTO gene is not directly associated with energy intake or physical activity. Independent of fatness, the A-allele of the FTO SNP appears to increase mortality of a magnitude similar to smoking, but without a particular underlying disease pattern barring an increase in the risk of diseases of the nervous system. Each copy of the risk-allele A at rs9939609 was significantly associated with 0.45 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.74; P = 0.004) and 0.97 cm increase in waist circumference (95% CI: 0.21-0.65; P = 0.0002). Similar results were observed for rs8050136. may confer a modest susceptibility to obesity in an ethnicity-specific manner, but may be '''unlikely to contribute to a clinically significant diabetes risk'''. A small study (less than 700 women, divided into 4+ groups) concluded that over 3 & 6 months women in a weight-loss program who were informed they carried at least one rs9939609 risk allele lost slightly more weight than non-carriers.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2419">rs5848(T;T) found a 3.2-fold increased risk vs C-allele carriers (95% CI: 1.50-6.73, p=0.003) for ubiquitin- and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive frontotemporal dementia (FTLD-U also knows as FTLD-TDP43), a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 10% of early-onset dementia patients. Detailed haplotype analysis was conducted, indicating rs5848 as most likely causal variant. FTLD-TDP43 is divided into four subtypes, some sources suggest association with type 3 only . Association between rs5848(T;T) and frontotemporal dementia is now generally assumed in literature, despite some studies failing to reproduce it.First meta-analysis of rs5848 association with Alzheimer's disease combining previous five studies for a total of 2502 Alzheimer's disease cases and 2162 controls found association in homozygous model (TT vs. CC: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11-1.66; P=0.003) as well as recessive model. This association existed also in the Caucasian-only subset of 2227 cases and 1902 controls. Although the ''p''-value is above usually applied guidelines, the researchers concluded the data indicates association exists .  According to "First symptoms--frontotemporal dementia versus Alzheimer's disease"  as well as other sources frontotemporal dementia is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease so it is possible some studies have misdiagnosed cases. FTLD is characterized by behavioral and/or language dysfunction, but usually without the amnesic syndrome involved in Alzheimer's disease at early stage.In contrast "Reduced serum progranulin level might be associated with Parkinson's disease risk"  found that only Parkinson's disease was associated with reduces progranulin levels, but found no association between progranulin levels, rs5848 or Alzheimer's disease. "Association between GRN rs5848 polymorphism and Parkinson's disease in Taiwanese population" found association between rs5848 and Parkinson's disease, but only for female Taiwanese (OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.43, 95% CI: 1.11-1.87, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.007 for single T allele among females). Most studies have found association with neurodegenerative disorders only for recessive or homozygous model, but this is one study where odds ratio follows number of alleles (OR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.24-3.78, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.006 for two alleles among females).A functional effect is suggested in many studies such as "GRN variant rs5848 reduces plasma and brain levels of granulin in Alzheimer's disease patients"  and "Rs5848 variant influences GRN mRNA levels in brain and peripheral mononuclear cells in patients with Alzheimer's disease" . In addition "rs5848 polymorphism and serum progranulin level"  showed that progranulin level is affected by number of (T) alleles equally both in 100 patients with different forms of dementia and 36 controls: TT (164 ng/mL, 95% C.I. 138-189), CT (191 ng/mL, 95% C.I. 177-206) and CC (222 ng/mL, 95% C.I. 205-238) serum progranulin with p < 0.005. Progranulin is a growth-factor involved in regulating tumorigenesis, wound repair, development, and inflammation among other things. Rs5848 is located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) RNA tail of GRN in a binding-site for miR-659 which inhibits GRN translation. University of California, San Francisco is currently conducting clinical trial " Finding Study of Nimodipine for the Treatment of Progranulin Insufficiency From GRN Gene Mutations". Common variation in the miR-659 binding-site of GRN is a major risk factor for TDP43-positive frontotemporal dementia.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4342">'''rs6010620''' is a SNP associated with atopic dermatitis (AD).  Also known as eczema, AD is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin disorders with a prevalence estimated up to 20% in children and 3% in adults .  It is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease that likely involves various genetic factors.  The SNP rs6010620 locates on chromosome 20q13.33, at which there are eight genes &#8212; ''PRIC285'', ''STMN3'', ''RTEL1'', ''TNFRSF6B'', ''ARFRP1'', ''ZGPAT'', and ''LIME1'' &#8212;, within a single 200-kb LD block around rs6010620.  Among them, ''TNFRSF6B'' and ''ZGPAT'' might be the susceptibility candidates whose expressions correlate with the SNP as suggested by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis .  rs6010620&#8217;s association with AD was first identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) published in 2011, involving 491,905 autosomal SNPs in 1,012 cases and 1,362 controls from southern China followed by two replication studies &#8212; one with an additional 3,624 cases and 12,197 controls of Chinese Han ethnicity, the other had 1,806 cases and 3,256 controls from Germany .  rs6010620 showed evidence for AD association in both the combined Chinese population (minor/risk allele G; ''P'' = 3.00 &#215; 10-8; OR = 1.17) and in the German cohort (minor allele A; risk allele G; ''P'' = 2.87 &#215; 10-5; OR = 0.80).The association was subsequently validated in a two-stage GWAS meta-analysis carried out later (''P'' = 0.002; OR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.03&#8211;1.15) .  This GWAS involved 5,606 cases and 20,565 controls from 16 population-based cohorts of European descent in the discovery meta-analysis, and the ten most strongly associated new susceptibility loci were then examined in the replication meta-analysis encompassing an additional 5,419 affected individuals and 19,833 controls from 14 studies.The group which published the first GWAS in 2011 recently validated the association as well with 4,538 cases and 13,412 controls from multiple cities in the central and northern parts of China (''P''GG = 1.83 &#215; 10-7; OR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.23&#8211;1.58) .  rs6010620&#8217;s association with subphenotypes of AD was examined in this study, and the SNP showed significant protective effect for sporadic AD (''P''genotype = 0.01; ''P''Bonferroni = 0.006; OR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.43&#8211;0.83).  Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6B (TNFRSF6B) is an immune receptor that plays a regulatory role in suppressing cell death .  It has been shown that mRNA expression of serum TNFRSF6B in AD patients are higher than those in healthy individuals and control subjects with non-atopic inflammatory diseases .  ''ZGPAT'', on the other hand, encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type with G patch domain-containing protein (ZIP) that transcriptionally represses several singling cascades including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway .  EGFR is overexpressed in skin lesions of AD patients and inhibition of its signaling induces dysregulated chemokine profiles that augment skin inflammation .  Taken together, these results indicate that ''TNFRSF6B'' and ''ZGPAT'' are indeed plausible causal genes for AD, while further fine mapping and functional studies are still needed before an unequivocal conclusion can be made on the exact susceptibility genes at 20q13.33 .----/ 23andMe blog rs6010620 G 1.28 Glioma</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1704">The SNP '''rs2076295''' on chromosome 6p24 is located within the intronic region of the DSP gene, which encodes the protein desmoplakin. Desmoplakin is a component of the desmosome, and is an adhesive intercellular molecule that tightly links adjacent cells for cell-cell adhesion. It is part of a dynamic structure that involves other proteins, such as plakoglobin and plakophilins, which tether the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane . The minor allele rs2076295(G) is reported by dbSNP to have an allele frequency (MAF) of 0.454.A recent case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 1,616 cases and 4,683 controls (and a replication study with 876 cases and 1,890 controls) was performed on non- Hispanic white individuals with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) ; note the correction posted online 1 Oct 2013. The most common and severe form of IIP is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IFP), and all forms of IIP (including IFP) were included in this study, in which a total of 439,828 SNPs were studied. Using an additive model for the minor allele at each SNP, a total of 19 SNPs, representing 7 chromosome locations, with genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) were identified in the GWAS discovery process.Apart from SNPs that have been previously associated with IIP in the MUC5B, TERT, and TERC genes , many of the other genome-wide significant SNPs reported in this study were newly discovered risk loci for IIP. Among them is '''rs2076295''' (minor allele = G; P<sub>meta</sub> = 1.1 x 10<sup>-19</sup>), which is in the intronic region of the DSP gene, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.43 for IIP (discovery GWAS). A related lung tissue gene expression study (100 IPF cases, 94 controls) showed that DSP expression was down-regulated in cases when compared to controls (P = 0.0002), and the expression level was genotype-dependent on the SNP (P = 0.002) &#8211; relative expression of DSP decreased with the number of copies of the putative risk allele, with GG alleles having the lowest level of expression, and TT the highest. This is consistent with the additive model used in the discovery GWAS.IIP represents a group of lung diseases that are often characterized by pulmonary fibrosis or progressive scarring of the alveolar interstitium, which can eventually lead to hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency and death . Some forms are known to be associated with environmental exposures (e.g. asbestos), drug toxicity, radiation exposure, or collagen vascular diseases (e.g. scleroderma). Previous studies have focused on the association between IIP and the MUC5B, TERT, and TERC genes. MUC5B encodes mucin 5B, expressed in mucus-producing cells in the distal airways of the lung. Lung tissue from individuals with IIP has higher concentrations of MUC5B than controls. TERT and TERC are involved in the maintenance of telomere lengths, and mutations in these genes are associated with shortened telomeres in the alveolar epithelia.The recently discovered association with the DSP locus suggests that changes in cell-cell adhesion may also play a role in IIP. Desmosomes (and desmoplakin) are important in maintaining the integrity of tissues that experience mechanical stress (such as the peripheral portions of the lung), and there is strong evidence that perturbation of the desmosome disrupts epithelial homeostasis . Mutations in DSP have also been associated with other diseases that involve loss of tissue integrity, such as in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia , keratodermas , and alopecia .</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4788">rs2736990 is a SNP associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degradation of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra.  Rs273990 is located on chromosome 4q22 in the synuclein-alpha SNCA locus. The function of SNCA is not fully understood, but it predominately found in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, and it is thought that it plays a role in maintaining adequate supplies of synaptic vesicles.  SNCA is also a major component of Lewy Bodies (LB), protein accumulations often found in neurons in patients with PD.The best evidence for the association of rs2736990 with PD was provided in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that found an increased frequency of the minor C allele (T is the major allele) in position 90897564 among cases compared to controls.   The study first identified this SNP in a pool of 1,713 cases and 3,978 controls of European ancestry.  The researchers then successfully replicated this significant finding in a separate group of 3,361 cases and 4,573 controls, also of European ancestry.   Estimates of effect size and statistical significance from the pooled dataset (which incorporates both groups) are as follows: OR = 1.23, p = 2.24 x 10-17 .   Several other studies have also examined the relationship between rs2736990 and PD. A group of Japanese researchers conducting a GWAS on 2,011 cases and 18,381 controls of Japanese descent found a significant association of rs2736990 with PD that survived Bonferroni correction (p-value not reported) .  Another group looked at only the rs2736990 SNP in 515 cases and 450 controls of Chinese descent and found the minor C allele was significantly more frequent in patients with PD (OR=1.26, p = 0.017).  Other studies have validated the association between rs2736990 and PD in European populations:  The Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center tested rs2736990 only in 344 cases and 275 controls and found a significant association (OR = 1.40, p = 0.0032); another group combined data from previous GWAS studies with their own data to create a GWAS dataset of 1752 cases and 1745 controls that yielded a significant association (OR = 1.29, p = 6.7 x 10-8) ; finally, a GWAS conducted on 772 cases and 2024 controls of Dutch descent found a significant association between rs2736990 and PD (OR = 1.325, p = 1.63 x 10-5). It is not known with certainty how mutations in synuclein-alpha contribute to PD; however, mutations in this gene, both missense and copy number variants, have been linked to the development of PD. In addition, rs2736990 is one of several SNP&#8217;s in the SNCA locus significantly associated with PD in GWAS studies, and the significant association of this SNP with PD has been replicated and validated in several subsequent studies.  Moreover, estimates of effect size are similar across studies.  As such, the biological plausibility of this mutation appears high.  One candidate mechanism for development of PD due to SNCA hypothesizes that misfolded or excessively produced synuclein-alpha proteins accumulate in the neuron and interfere with normal function until they eventually cause death. This theory is supported by the abundance of synuclein-alpha proteins in LB&#8217;s found in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.  However, it is unclear if these LB&#8217;s are a response to injury or themselves the cause of death. Linkage disequilibrium patterns and tagSNP transferability among European populations.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4030">Rs7665116 is located in an intronic region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1A gene, which codes for the protein PGC-1&#945;. The PGC-1 &#945; protein is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, thermogenesis, and molecular mechanisms responsible for cellular respiration.  PGC-1 &#945; has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington&#8217;s disease, as mutant huntingtin protein in HD patients inhibits the PGC-1&#945; system. The G polymorphism of the rs7665116 SNP has been associated with a three to five year delay in the age of onset of Huntington&#8217;s disease relative to the wildtype A allele.The rs7665116 SNP is located at the 3&#8217; end of intron 2 of PPARGC1A, in a highly conserved region of the gene. Though the majority of the variance in age of onset of Huntington&#8217;s disease is explained by the length of the CAG repeat in the HTT gene, a small portion of the variance (~4.3%) in age of onset is explained by rs7665116.  The CAG repeat length is causative of Huntington&#8217;s disease, One study conducted on a cohort of 854 European individuals (401 cases and 453 controls) revealed that the G variant of the rs76651116 SNP was associated with a delay in HD onset (p=0.0389 in the additive model and p=0.0112 in the dominant model). The association was particularly strong in the Italian population of participants, which comprised 312 of the 854 individuals (p=0.0172 in the additive model and p=0.0045 in the dominant model). For the rest of the population, the association was not statistically significant. Further studies will be necessary to determine significance in non-Italian populations.  Another study was conducted on a cohort of 400 German patients to determine various genetic modifiers of Huntington&#8217;s disease in order to create a multivariable model explaining the variance in age of onset of the disease. The transcriptional factors nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) regulate the are also implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis, and SNPs in these genes, along with rs7555116,  can explain 4.8% of the additional residual variance in the age of onset of the loss of motor coordination symptom of Huntington&#8217;s disease through a gene-gene interaction model.  The exact mechanism for these interactions remains unknown, and the experiment has yet to be replicated and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing in order to more clearly explain how NRF-1, TFAM, and PGC-1 &#945; interact to affect Huntington&#8217;s age of onset.  In general, this study underscores role of impaired mitochondrial function in the pathogenesis of Huntington&#8217;s, suggesting that upstream transcriptional factors of PCG1-1 &#945; may be useful targets for treating HD. One study conducted on a cohort of 234 (155 controls and 79 cases) Huntington&#8217;s patients of Italian descent demonstrated that the age of onset increased  depending on the genotype of rs7665116. For patients with an A/A genotype, age of onset was on average 45.08 years, while A/G patients were 48.75, and G/G patients began to show symptoms at age 49.09. Statistical significance was maintained after the application of the Bonferroni correction (p<0.02 for the additive model and p<0.005 for the dominant model).

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4319">In mice, the genetic locus best correlated to anxiety-related behaviour contains the 'regulator of G protein signaling 2' gene . In humans, SNPs in the equivalent RGS2 gene have now been studied to see if they are correlated to anxiety related disorders.In the first part of one study, 119 families including children underwent standard lab-based behavioural assessments of behavioural inhibition, defined as a heritable temperamental profile characterized by a tendency to be shy, avoident, and behaviourally restrained in situations that are novel or unfamiliar. Along with some other RGS2 SNPs, carriers of a rs4606(G) allele were 3 fold more likely to exhibit behavioural inhibition (CI: 1.31-6.84, p = 0.0026).In the second part of this study, 744 college undergraduates (228 men, 516 women) who had been genotyped completed a personality profile known as the NEO-E (introversion) association test. Consistent with the earlier results, the same RGS2 alleles associated with behavioural inhibition were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with introversion (but not neuroticism), including rs4606(G), rs6428136(G), and rs10801152(T).In the third part of this study, 55 female undergraduates were studied by fMRI (functional MRI) emotional processing tests. Carriers of SNPs rs4606(G) or rs10801152(T) showed increased insular cortex activation, a reflection of anxiety, in these tests.Based on these results, the authors predict that social anxiety disorder is the most likely anxiety disorder to be associated with SNPs in the RGS2 gene such as rs4606.   SNPs in the RGS2 gene, including rs4606, show association with childhood temperament, adult personality, and brain function. each rs4606(C) allele was associated with a 2x (p =.026) increased risk of generalized anxiety disorder. 173 patients with panic disorder (and 173 matched controls) of German descent analyzed, leading to the conclusion that rs4606(G) carriers were at ~2x increased risk for this disorder. Note that the (G) allele appears to be the minor (rarer) allele in this study.'''Note:''' given the conflicting reports over whether the (C) or (G) allele is implicated in anxiety-related disorders, Dr. Jordan Smoller was contacted to verify that the orientation was unambiguously reported in the various publications. He has confirmed that the reports truly vary in which allele is considered the risk allele; this may be an example of the "flip-flop" phenomenon .rs4606 has also been reported to be associated with the development of Parkinson's like symptoms in schizophrenia patients treated with various drugs, as follows: A replication study was performed in which extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were rated in 184 US patients with schizophrenia. This group (115 African Americans, 69 Caucasian) was treated for at least a month with typical antipsychotic drugs (n=45), risperidone (n=46), olanzapine (n=50) or clozapine (n=43). The minor (G) allele showed a protective effect against antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism (AIP), with an odds ratio for AIP among rs4606(G) carriers of 0.23 (CI: 0.10-0.54, p=0.001) for the overall sample./ blog discussion 121 consecutively hospitalized, psychotic patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-IV schizophrenia receiving treatment with typical antipsychotic medication (n=72) or typical antipsychotic drugs and risperidone (n=49) for at least 2 weeks were studied. After correction for multiple testing the only RGS2 SNP associated with development or worsening of parkinsonian symptoms was rs4606 (p=0.002). rs4606 modifies risk of postdisaster and lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms under conditions of high stressor exposure</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="180">rs13166360 at 5p15.31 is located in an exon of adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2) and encodes a missense mutation (valine&#8594;leucine) in a transmembrane domain of the protein. A GWAS has associated '''rs13166360''' with bipolar disorder in people of European ancestry. == '''Clinical Background''' ==Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a severe mood disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and mania. BD has a lifetime prevalence of 1% in the general population (4% in the United States), and therefore can be classified as a common condition. To date, there does not exist any clear associations between race or socioeconomic status, and the onset of BD. Bipolar Disorders are amongst the 10 highest burden diseases, as ranked by the World Health Organization. In particular, those suffering from bipolar disorder are at a higher risk of suicide, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse . For further information about bipolar disorder, wikipedia offers a great article: .== '''SNP Data''' ==A GWAS by Muhleisen and coworkers links '''rs13166360''' to Bipolar Disorder. The authors were motivated by the success of a previous GWAS for bipolar disorder  that had not implicated the ADCY2 gene, and added additional subjects (2,266) and controls (5,028) in order to increase the power of this study. This data primarily comes from the MooDS (Systematic Investigation of the Molecular Causes of Major Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia) consortium. The new data unique to the Muhleisen et al study, which helped to find '''rs13166360''', was primarily genotyped on the Illumina Infinium assay. In all, the combined datasets analyzed ~2.3 million SNPs from 9,747 cases and 14,278 controls that are of European Ancestry, but who currently live in Europe, Australia and the USA. This represents the largest BD GWAS to date. The datasets were merged according to a standardized genomic control &#955;-factor (1.018) in order to control for p-value inflation. The meta-analysis found 56 SNPs that passed genome-wide significance at 5 distinct genetic loci. Of these 5 loci, 3 had been previously described (ANK3, ODZ4, and TRANK1), while two were completely novel (ADCY2 and the region between MIR2113 and POU3F2)'''Rs13166360''' was found as a proxy to another novel SNP (rs17836816) in the ADCY2 gene (r2=0.95), and presented genome-wide significance (p-value 1.81x10-8 with an allelic odds ratio of 1.14). Neither had previously been described in the context of Bipolar Disorder, and ADCY2 SNPs had not previously been associated with BD. '''Rs13166360''' describes a deviation from the major allele G to T (minor allele) that encodes a Valine to Leucine missense codon in ADCY2.== '''Relation to Disease''' ==There is consensus amongst the scientific and medical community that Bipolar Disorder is a multifactorial disease, with both genetic and environmental causes. ADCY2 is an integral membrane protein that, upon activation by heterotrimertic G proteins, catalyzes formation of the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that then activates protein kinase A (PKA) pathways. Many neurotransmitters function through G protein-coupled receptors, that in turn signal through these heterotrimeric G proteins. GPCRs represent a large pool of candidate genes for neuropsychiatric disorders, and accordingly, many antipsychotics target multiple receptors at once. Since ADCY2 is a signal integrator that acts downstream of many of these signaling pathways, any altercation to its function would occur downstream of multiple receptors and neurotransmitter pathways. It is not currently known if the V147L mutation is deleterious to the protein. While multiple adenylate cyclase genes exist, ADCY2 is uniquely expressed in the brain.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1428">rs4244285 is a SNP in the CYP2C19 gene, potentially encoding the CYP2C19 2 variant. This variant is the most common reason for poor metabolism of compounds like mephenytoin (an anti-convulsant), some antidepressants, the anti-platelet drug Plavix, and some drugs used for ulcer conditions of various types. The risk allele is rs4244285(A).As a nonfunctioning CYP2C19, this variant would be expected to be a poor metabolizer of several commonly prescribed drugs, including anti-ulcer drugs like omeprazole (trade names Losec and Prilosec), esomeprazole (trade name Nexium), and lansoprazole (trade name Prevacid).In Caucasians, SNPs in CYP2C19 are relatively rare (in contrast to SNPs in CYP2D6), but SNPs in this gene are common in Asians. Ulcer treatment with omeprazole to reduce Helicobacter pylori has been shown to vary depending on a patient's CYP2C19 genotype, varying from 28% in patients homozygous for CYP2C19 alleles encoding fully functional proteins to 100% in patients with variations leading to poor metabolism. The fact that poor metabolizers for many cytochrome p450s achieve higher therapeutic success for some drugs is speculated to be because for some of the drug being broken down (ie metabolized) slower, the effective concentrations are both higher and longer lasting. However, other drugs clearly work less well in carriers of reduced function CYP2C19 alleles. An example of such a drug is clopidogrel, sold under the brand name Plavix. This has now (2010) been acknowledged by the FDA, who have added a boxed warning to Plavix, alerting patients and health care professionals that the drug can be less effective in people who have CYP2C19 variants and cannot convert the drug as effectively to its active form. recent (December 2008) studies reach similar (though not identical) conclusions about the consequences of CYP2C19 2 allele carriers prescribed clopidogrel to reduce their cardiovascular risk:  A study of 245 French patients under 45 years of age prescribed clopidogrel after surviving a first heart attack concluded that rs4244285(A) allele carriers were at 4x higher risk (CI: 1&#183;81&#8212;9&#183;02, p=0&#183;0006) for subsequent adverse cardiovascular events compared to noncarriers.  A study of 2,208 French patients prescribed clopidogrel, of which 225 subsequently died and 94 had a nonfatal heart attack or stroke, came to two conclusions :   Patients carrying any two CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles ( 2,  3,  4, or  5), had about a 2x increased risk (21.5% vs. 13.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.98; CI: 1.10-3.58) for adverse cardiovascular events than CYP2C19 1 homozygotes.   Among the 1,535 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty) during hospitalization, patients with two CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles were at even higher risk for adverse events: 3.58x (CI: 1.71-7.51) compared to CYP2C19 1 homozygotes.  A study of 1,477 subjects with acute coronary syndromes who were treated with clopidogrel as part of the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TRITON-TIMI) 38 study concluded that rs4244285(A) allele carriers had a 1.53x increased risk for death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke, as compared with noncarriers (12.1% vs. 8.0%; CI: 1.07-2.19, p=0.01) and were at 3x higher risk of stent thrombosis (2.6% vs. 0.8%; CI: 1.19-8.00, p=0.02).   CYP2C19 2 loss-of-function genotypes were associated with diminished platelet response to clopidogrel treatment and poorer cardiovascular outcomes in a study of 429 healthy Amish individuals treated for 7 days (in the first study) and 227 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty) (in the second study).

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3168">Rs4245739 at 1q32 is located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region (UTR) of MDM4, positioned 32 bp downstream from the gene.  The MDM4 oncoprotein negatively regulates the tumor suppressor protein P53, effectively inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell growth.  Amplification of MDM4 is observed in multiple tumor types, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated SNP rs4245739 with several forms of cancer.SNPs that are situated in 3&#8217;-UTRs can potentially affect translation efficiency by altering miRNA-mediated gene regulation.  The '''rs4245739''' A > C polymorphism creates a novel binding site for miR-191 , thereby inhibiting expression of the ''MDM4'' oncogene.  Consequently, the major allele A acts as the risk allele, while the minor allele C is protective.===Prostate Cancer===A GWAS by Eeles et al.  linked rs4245739 to prostate cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related death for men in the developed world &#8211; especially in Europe and the United States.  Eeles et al. used the iCOGS chip to genotype 19,662 prostate cancer cases and 19,715 controls, all of European ancestry.  The results were subsequently pooled with data from a meta-analysis of 4 previous GWAS covering 11,085 cases and 11,463 controls in populations with European ancestry.  The combined results identified 77 loci associated with prostate cancer, which together explain ~30% of the disease&#8217;s familial risk.  One of the new SNPs identified was '''rs4245739''', which presented genome-wide significance (p = 2.1e-11).  The major allele A is the risk allele, with a per-allele odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05 &#8211; 1.14).  '''Rs4245739''' is correlated with rs1380576 (''r''<sup>2</sup> = 0.89), which has been linked to prostate cancer aggressiveness , as well as rs7556371 (''r''<sup>2</sup> = 0.89), which was associated with prostate cancer susceptibility in a candidate gene study .===Breast Cancer===Rs4245739 has also been linked to susceptibility for breast cancer, which ranks as the fifth-most common cause of cancer death worldwide.  In another GWAS utilizing the iCOGS array, Garcia-Glosas et al.  investigated loci associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, which account for ~25% of all breast cancer cases.  They genotyped 6,514 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 41,455 controls of European ancestry, the results of which were combined with a meta-analysis of 3 previous GWAS totaling 4,193 ER-negative cases and 35,194 controls, also of European ancestry.  SNP '''rs4245739''' was identified as one of four loci associated with ER-negative but not ER-positive breast cancer.  Based on the pooled results, the association with ER-negative breast cancer showed genome-wide significance (p = 2.1e-12).  The A risk allele presented an odds ratio of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.10&#8211;1.18).A candidate gene study  genotyped a total of 1,100 breast cancer cases and 1,400 controls from two regions of China.  This work focused specifically on breast cancer in relation to SNP '''rs4245739''' and its potential interplay with the P53 Arg72Pro genetic variant.  When compared to CA and CC, the AA genotype was found to be associated with breast cancer (p =  4.6e-6), with an odds ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.36&#8211;0.61) for the C protective allele.  For individuals with the P53 Arg/Arg genotype, the association was even stronger (p = 5.3e-12) with an odds ratio of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.08&#8211;0.27), suggesting a possible additive effect of ''MDM4'' and ''P53'' on breast cancer susceptibility.Additionally, smaller scale studies have reported association of rs4245739 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  and ovarian cancer severity and progression .</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4259">rs6445975 is located on chromosome 3p14.3 and corresponds to intron 4 in the PXK gene (Phox homology domain containing serine/threonine kinase) and is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PXK is expressed in a variety of tissues including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This SNP has also been implicated as being an important modulator of cancer cell growth . For the rs6445975 SNP, the ancestral allele is a T and the disease associated risk allele is a G.rs6445975 was first found to be associated with SLE in 2008 in women of European ancestry. The study included 720 women with SLE and 2,337 controls and showed strong evidence for association (P=7.1x10&#8211;9; OR=1.25) . Additionally, a study in 2010 found that many SLE SNPs including rs6445975 showed that an increase in genetic susceptibility to SLE was associated with early disease onset. . Other studies have shown no association of rs6445975 with SLE. A study of patients mainly of Mexican ancestry included 804 patients with SLE and 667 healthy controls and found no association (Odds ratio=1.077; 95% CI=0.8&#8211;1.45; P=0.622). Another study of 910 SLE patients and 1440 healthy controls from Chinese living in Hong Kong and 278 SLE patients and 383 controls from Thailand, also found no association of rs6445975 to SLE (P=0.36, OR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.93&#8211;1.21). . A study from 2009 investigated if rs6445975 was associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) because SLE and RA share a complex etiology. They found no association of several SLE SNPs with RA, including rs6445975 (OD=1.11; 95% CI=1.0&#8211;1.2). A study of SLE in the Chinese mainland population used 288 cases and 357 controls and showed that rs6445975 is not associated with SLE (P=0.969; OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.75&#8211;1.32). . Another study examined the association of rs6445975with SLE in 527 Korean patients with SLE and 517 healthy Korean control subjects. They found no association of the rs6445975 risk allele with SLE (OR= 1.06; P=0.57). A study investigated the link between SLE and a decreased breast cancer risk in a cohort of 3,659 breast cancer cases and 4,897controls of primarily European descent. They found a slight positive association with breast cancer for the G risk allele of rs6445975 (OR=1.0911; P=0.0097) but concluded an overall weak association of breast cancer with SLE. A recent study performed a meta-analysis of 13 separate studies and identi&#64257;ed an association between SLE and the G allele of rs6445975 in the overall population (OR=1.151, 95 % CI=1.086&#8211;1.291, P=1.8E-06). There was a signi&#64257;cant association between rs6445975 and SLE in Europeans (OR=1.198, 95 % CI=1.118&#8211;1.285, P=3.4E-07), but not in Asians as expected from other studies.  Currently there is no cure for SLE, but symptoms can be managed by immunosuppressant drug treatments such as cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Generally, SLE is more common in women than in men and SLE is associated with disease risk alleles of SNPs in the following genes: ITGAM, KIAA1542, PXK, FCGR2A, PTPN22 and STAT4. Additionally, SNPs in the HLA-DQA1 and IRF5 genes have been shown to have a protective phenotype in women of European ancestry but not Asian ancestry. Most of the GWA studies performed for SLE that have been duplicated, found their results to be reproducible after accounting for differences in populations such as Europeans and Asians. rs6445975 particularly, has been shown to affect Europeans but not Asians or Mexicans. Some other studies such as those performed on Mexican or African American populations have yet to be repeated and so reliable data is not currently available.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2517">rs1800562 represents a SNP that accounts for ~85% of all cases of hemochromatosis, a disorder whose symptoms include cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, hypermelanotic pigmentation of the skin, and heart failure.  OMIM indicates that liver cancer is responsible for about one-third of deaths of rs1800562(A;A) homozygotes, and since hemochromatosis is a relatively easily treated disorder if diagnosed, this is a form of preventable cancer.The rs1800562(A) allele is known as the C282Y or Cys282Tyr mutation, and it is found at a frequency of around 5-10% in many Caucasian populations, leading to an incidence of (A;A) homozygotes around 1 in 200. Early identification of rs1800562(A;A) homozygotes can prevent complications of hemochromatosis; however, the percentage of all (A;A) homozygotes who actually develop clinical signs of hemochromatosis may be relatively low, may depend on sex (see below), and appears to be influenced by other SNPs yet to all be discovered as well as (unidentified) environmental factors, possibly including the amount of iron in the diet.In rs1800562(A;A) patients who do develop hemochromatosis, a SNP has been identified which increases the risk of cardiomyopathy (a form of heart disease). rs4880(T;T) homozygotes are at ~10 fold increased risk for dilated- or non-dilated cardiopathy based on a study of 217 patients.rs235756, a SNP in the BMP2 gene, is another SNP that may influence the development of hemochromatosis in rs1800562(A;A) individuals, at least if serum transferrin levels are a good indication. Transferrin levels increased with increasing copies of the rs235756(T) allele.  So what percent of rs1800562(A;A) individuals actually develop clinical signs of hemochromatosis? At least in the UK (Caucasian) population, a 2019 survey reported that of 2890 participants homozygous for p.C282Y (0.6%, or 1 in 156), hemochromatosis was diagnosed in 21.7% of men and 9.8% of women over an average follow up (~7 years). p.C282Y homozygous men aged 40 to 70 had a higher prevalence of diagnosed hemochromatosis (OR 411.1, CI: 299-565, p<0.001), liver disease (4.30, 2.97-6.18, p<0.001), rheumatoid arthritis (2.23, 1.51-3.31, p<0.001), osteoarthritis (2.01, 1.71-2.36, p<0.001), and diabetes mellitus (1.53, 1.16-1.98, p=0.002), versus 175,000+ controls (people with no p.C282Y mutations). During the seven year follow-up, 15.7% of homozygous men developed at least one incident associated condition versus 5.0% (p<0.001) with no p.C282Y mutations; for women, it was 10.1% vs 3.4%, p<0.001).Women who are rs1800562(A) homozygotes are less affected by hemochromatosis due to elimination of excess iron during menstruation, but may become affected after menopause.Carriers of one rs1800562(A) may be affected by a mild form of hemochromatosis if also a carrier of rs1799945(G) H63D.According to  Coriell, in Caucasian populations: (A;A) - 0.4% of individuals, carrying 2 copies of the risk variant (33-57% of such males will have quite elevated iron levels; 3-16% if female) (G;A) - 12% carry 1 copy of the risk variant and 1 copy of the non-risk variant (G;G) - 87.6% carry (only) the non-risk variant Was the C282Y mutation an Irish Gaelic mutation that the Vikings helped disseminate? Conclusion: The C282Y frequency shows a west to east decline from Ireland through the north of Europe. Vikings may have been involved in the spread of C282Y, but the mutation is probably older and may have been spread in Europe by earlier seafarers.</p>

A 2012 review of three of the most studied PTGS2 gene variants concluded the following about rs20417:  The C variant is associated with lower promoter activity compared with the G variant;  The C variant is found in a haplotype with -1195G>A (rs689466) in Pima Indians, Chinese Asians, and Australian Caucasians, and with -1290A>G (rs689465) in a Caucasian Australian population;  The epidemiological relevance of rs20417 is unclear and/or conflicting despite numerous studies (and this includes studies of myocardial infarction, diabetes, asthma, various cancers, and the use of NSAIDs to reduce coronary heart disease risk).

    [[ID:q1891]]
    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1891">rs396991 is a SNP in the Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIIa, receptor (CD16a) FCGR3A gene. rs396991(T) encodes the phenylalanine (F) allele, with the (G) allele encoding the variant valine (V). The (V) isoform is considered high-binding to IgG1 and IgG3, while the (F) isoform is considered low-binding. This SNP is known in the literature by many names, including A559C, T559G, 158F/V, and 176F/V.What's the importance of this? FcgRIIIa stimulatory receptors are expressed by most cells in the immune system, including monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, platelets and endothelial cells, as well as a subpopulation of T-cells. FcgR isoforms have been linked to the pathogenic consequences triggered by autoantibodies or immune complexes in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as to the efficacy of some immunotherapeutic treatments such as rituximab.Many studies have been published about this FCGR3A SNP, roughly divided by either disorder or treatment as follows:  HIV to AIDs, including susceptibility and progression:   In a study of 2 cohorts of men infected with HIV, the rs396991(T;T) (ie F/F) genotype was underrepresented in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, whereas the heterozygous genotype was associated with its development. A similar association was observed between rs396991 genotypes and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) seropositivity.  Crohn's disease   A study of 300+ patients with Crohn's disease determined that the rs396991(T) allele had an odds ratio of 1.58 (CI: 1.06-2.35) and the (G;T) genotype an odds ratio of 1.64 (CI: 1.08-2.5) for the disease.  Rheumatoid arthritis   Meta-analysis of 10 different studies concluded that amongst European subjects (and not Asians), the VV (rs396991(G;G)) genotype was associated with increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis, with an odds ratio of 1.374 (CI: 1.101-1.714, p = 0.005) as compared to the FF genotype.   Although rs396991 is unlikely to play a major role by itself in susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of the rs396991(G) high-binding allele may predispose shared epitope positive individuals to the disease.Classifying the reports by immunotherapeutic treatment studied yields the following:  Studies involving rituximab:   In a study of ~200 Korean patients, the FCGR3A valine (V) allele was significantly correlated with a higher complete response rate to rituximab plus cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy compared with the phenylalanine (F) allele (88% in V/V vs 79% in V/F vs 50% in F/F; p = .002), although it did not correlate with survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).   In a study of 58 Croatian patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rs396991 did not influence response, event-free or overall survival.   A study of 49 patients receiving rituximab for previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma concluded that rs396991(G;G) patients have a 75% to 90% chance of experiencing a clinical response to rituximab monotherapy, whereas patients with at least one rs396991(T) allele have a 25% to 51% chance of responding.   Another study of 89 patients with follicular lymphoma found that rs396991 genotype was associated with the response rate and freedom from progression after treatment with rituximab.   Studies involving cetuximab:   In a study of 39 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab, the rs396991(G) (ie F) allele was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.055), by perhaps 1-2 months.  Studies involving trastuzumab:   A retrospective analysis of 1,251 patients included in a phase III trial of women with ERBB2/HER2-positive breast cancer concluded that rs396991(G) carriers (i.e. FCGR3A-158 V carriers) benefit the most, as measured by disease-free survival, from trastuzumab use compared to rs396991(T:T) (i.e. FCGR3A-158 F/F) genotypes.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3652">The rs1799971(G) allele in exon 1 of the mu opioid receptor OPRM1 gene causes the normal amino acid at residue 40, asparagine (Asn), to be replaced by aspartic acid (Asp). In the literature this SNP is also known as A118G, N40D, or Asn40Asp.Carriers of at least one rs1799971(G) allele appear to have stronger cravings for alcohol than carriers of two rs1799971(A) alleles, and are thus hypothesized to be more at higher risk for alcoholism. However, subsequent research results are mixed, and there are other studies both agreeing or disagreeing with this finding PMID 15525999, PMID 9399694, PMID 12960749Among 200+ alcoholics treated with naltrexone, rs1799971(G) carriers receiving the drug (even without behavioral intervention) had an increased percentage of days abstinent (p = .07) and a decreased percentage of heavy drinking days (p = .04) if treated with naltrexone vs. placebo, whereas rs1799971(A;A) homozygotes showed no medication differences. Upon treatment with naltrexone, 87% of rs1799971(G) carriers had a good clinical outcome, compared with only 55% of individuals with the (A;A) genotype (odds ratio, 5.75, CI: 1.88-17.54)This SNP may also influence the response to opioids such as heroin, codeine or morphine. A 2015 meta-analysis (totaling 5,902 patients) concluded that the carriers of a rs1799971(G) allele consumed more opioids for analgesia (SMD = -0.17, CI:-0.25, -0.10, p < 0.00001), but still reported higher pain scores (p = 0.002) and less nausea and vomiting (odds ratio 1.30, CI:1.08-1.55, p= 0.005) than homozygous (A;A) patients during the first 24 hour, but not 48 hour, postoperative period.A study of 200 Chinese heroin addicts found increased frequency for the rs1799971(G) allele compared to non-addicts (40% vs 29%) ; but another study of Han Chinese addicts found no difference ./ 23andMe blog Alcoholism related rs1799971(A;A) severe alcoholism 2x  rs1799732(I;I) severe alcoholism 1.85x A clinical genetic method to identify mechanisms by which pain causes depression and anxiety.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4995">This 2003 article titled "Amino acid substitutions in the thyroglobulin gene are associated with susceptibility to human and murine autoimmune thyroid disease" performed case control association studies for 14 TG SNPs in 285 Caucasian AITD (autoimmune thyroid disease) patients and 150 Caucasian controls. They found that within the TG gene, "exon 10-12 SNP cluster and an exon 33 SNP were significantly associated with AITD."  Four polymorphisms, considered separately, had ODs over 1.3, but p values were not strong, between 0.003 and 0.12. (Supplementary tables 10,11,12) However, they discovered more significant ODs and p values when combining one or more exon 10-12 SNP alleles with the CC homozygous exon 33 polymorphism:     with or without E10SNP24 T/G = rs180223 = T allele,    with or without E10SNP158 T/C = rs2069550 = T allele,    with or without E12SNP A/G = rs853326 = A allele,     always with E33SNP = rs2076740 = CC polymorphism ODs for risk of AITD were given with the above risk alleles in combination (Table 2):   T,T,A,CC = 2.49 (p=0.0004);   T,--,--,CC = 2.42 (p=0.0005);   --,T,--,CC = 2.52 (p=0.0003);   --,--,A,CC = 2.43 (p=0.0004) The ODs for risk of HT (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and GD (Graves' disease) were similar, all above 2.38 with p values equally or more significant. (Tables 3,4) Adding significance for the exon 33 SNP in particular, they discovered "an interaction between HLA-DR3 and the exon 33 SNP" resulting in an odds ratio of 6.1 for GD. NOTE: The large odds ratio may be due to the small sample size of this study. In addition, this study focused on a Caucasian sample. Nevertheless, other studies focused on regional samples have shown similar trends. A 2015 research study titled "Correlation between thyroglobulin gene polymorphisms and autoimmune thyroid disease" focused on the Han Chinese population. A total of 270 patients with AITD and 135 healthy controls were enrolled. They found "The Tg SNP frequency distribution was significantly different between Han populations of the Northern regions of Henan province and the Xi'an regions of Shaanxi province" (Abstract).  Separate ODs were found for the following TG gene SNPs:   E10SNP24 T/G rs180223 = TT 1.35, TG 11.50, GG 0.14, (TG OD was 95%CI = 4.89-27.06, p=<0.01)  E10SNP158 T/C rs2069550 = TT 1.07, TC 0.96, CC 1.03  E12SNP A/G rs853326 = AA 0.51, AG 0.23, GG 4.22 (GG OD was 95%CI = 2.65-6.73, p=<0.01)  E33SNP C/T rs2076740 = CC 1.11, CT 0.93, TT 0.98. More significant combined ODs were received when these SNPs were were combined:  GTAC = 0.22 Hypothyroidism (HY), 0.22 Graves(GD), 0.24 Hashimoto's (HT)   GCGC = 0.57 HT  GTGC = 3.57 GD, 3.50 HT  TTGC = 4.00 HY  TCGC = 5.23 HY, 3.00 GD, 4.45 HT A 2016 study titled "Association of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) and Thyroglobulin (TG) Genetic Variants with Autoimmune Hypothyroidism" sampled 84 hypothyroidism patients and 62 controls from Gujarat, India. Researchers found that polymorphisms of the TG gene's exon 33 SNP rs2076740 significantly increased the odds of autoimmune hypothyroidism: Odds ratios were   for TT, 1.0 (Genotypes were similar between patients and controls)  for TC, 7.519 (95%CI 2.329 to 24.27, p=0.0003) compared to AA (7.729 after adjustment for age and gender).  for CC, 20.54 (95%CI 5.065 to 83.30, p=0.0001) compared to AA (15.151 after adjustment for age and gender).Researchers theorized that the TG polymorphism may "change its antigenicity making it more immunogenic" (Conclusion). They also found significant differences in patients vs. controls when analyzing the CTLA4 SNP Exon1 (+49A/G) rs231775. NOTE: The large odds ratio may be attributed to the small number of patients and controls and/or the regional sample.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2212">'''rs4143094''' is a SNP identified by a genome-wide diet-gene interaction analysis (GxE), and was found to be associated with increased risk of colon cancer correlated to the dietary variable of processed meat consumption. It is located on chromosome 10p14, 7.2kb upstream of GATA binding protein 3 (''GATA3''), in the promoter region of the gene  rs4143094 was identified in a screen of 2.7 million SNPs for the risk of colorectal cancer, by combining 10 studies comparing 9287 cases and 9117 controls. Data was obtained from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and analyzed by conventional case-control logistic regression for multiplicative interactions between SNPs and dietary factors. rs4143094 was the most significantly implicated SNP in 10p14 for processed meat consumption linked with occurrence of colorectal cancer. The risk allele (T) has an ORinteraction=1.17, p=8.73E-09 with evidenced heterogenetity by p=0.78. When stratifying by genotype, rs4143094-TG has OR=1.2, 95% CI=1.13-1.26; rs4143094-TT has an OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.22-1.59; and the minor/null genotype rs4143094-GG has an OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.98-1.07.  Several other SNPs in the 10p14 region were correlated to the same phenotype, (rs485411, risk allele C, ORinteraction=1.18; Pinteraction=1.72E-08; rs1269486, risk allele A, ORinteraction=1.18, Pinteraction=7.53E-08) though rs4143094 was highlighted due to having the most significant P-value.Colorectal cancer is the third most leading cause of cancer death in men and women , and consumption of processed meat has been linked to increased risk of its development , . rs4143094 is upstream of ''GATA3'', a gene associated with Th2 cell differentiation , which is upregulated in ulcerative colitis , a risk factor for colorectal cancer . Though the mechanism by which ''GATA3'' suppression may lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer is unknown, its suppression has been previously linked to breast, colorectal, and lung cancers . DOJ  Association between risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat.rs4143094 on chromosome 10p14 is about 7.2kb upstream of GATA3 gene. GATA3 belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors. Its functional role includes regulation of luminal epithelial cell differentiation, development of T cell, and differentiation of T helper (Th) cell. Genes in the GATA family are involved in several types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and of particular interest to this entry, colorectal cancer    . According to dbSNP, rs4143094 has two alleles, G (major allele) and T (minor allele). The minor allele has a frequency of 0.2337 across all populations. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), using data from Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), discovered a strong correlation between rs4143094 and risk of colorectal cancer when ingesting red and processed meat . In the study, approximately 2.7M SNPs were tested across 9,287 case and 9,117 control subjects, all with European ancestry. The result shows that rs4143094 is associated with risk of colorectal cancer (P = 8.73e-9), with T being the risk allele. Specifically, individuals with TG and TT genotypes are increased for occurrence of colorectal cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 and 1.39, respectively. rs4143094 resides in a 9.5 kb linkage-disequilibrium (LD) block (r2 > 0.8) containing 19 highly correlated SNPs. The third most significant among these SNPs, rs1269486, is located 1420 bases upstream of GATA3 and is in a region of open chromatin (DNA hypersensitivity). Experimental evidence suggests binding activity of Pol2 and transcription factors c-Fos, JunD, and c-Jun in this region . Many other SNPs in the LD block reside in GATA3-antisense RNA1 (GATA3-AS1).  GATA3-AS1 may regulate GATA3 transcript activity, although further experimental evidence is required. Apart from the SNP, this study also observed that red and processed meat consumption increases risk for colorectal cancer with OR of 1.15 and 1.11, respectively. For this secondary result, the author proposed the following pathway: processed meat triggers pro-tumorigenic inflammatory or immunological response, whose recovery depends upon the expression of GATA3 gene. Further experimental evidence is required to confirm this hypothesis.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="349">rs1800497, a SNP also known as the TaqIA (or Taq1A) polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor DRD2 gene (even though it is actually located over 10,000bp downstream of the gene), gives rise to the DRD2 A1 allele, whereas rs1800497(C) gives rise to the DRD2 A2 allele. The minor allele (i.e. A1, rs1800497(T)) is associated with a reduced number of dopamine binding sites in the brain , and it has been postulated to play a role in alcoholism, smoking, and certain neuropsychiatric disorders.The reduced number of dopamine binding sites may play a role in nicotine addiction by causing an "understimulated" state that can be relieved by smoking (and/or use of other drugs). It may also be associated with reduced response to errors and increased addictive behavior.A wide variety of reports have been published over more than ten years either linking rs1800497 to aspects of nicotine use and smoking cessation success, or finding no such association. A meta-analysis of 41 such studies published in 2004 concluded that overall the association of rs1800497 with such phenomena was statistically weak.  This same group published (in 2009) a study showing no association between rs1800497 and improved response to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), contrary to their previous study.More recently, a relatively large study of over 700 patients attempting to kick their smoking habit using the drug bupropion determined that smokers homozygous for the A2/A2 genotype were more successful than A1/A2 or A1/A1 individuals. The A2/A2 smokers were more than three times as likely, relative to placebo, to be abstinent at end of treatment (35.2% vs. 15.1%; odds ratio = 3.25, CI: 2.00-5.28) and at 6 months of follow-up (26.7% vs. 12.2%; odds ratio = 2.81, CI: 1.66-4.77), whereas not so much by 12 months (16.3% vs. 10.7%; OR = 1.70, CI: 0.95-3.05). Basically, A1/A2 and A1/A1 genotype smokers didn't gain anything from using bupropion versus placebo; bupropion only helped A2/A2 genotypes stop smoking. In a study of individuals in the Polyp Prevention Trial with any, multiple (>/=2) or advanced colorectal adenoma recurrence after 4 years, compared to those without adenoma recurrence, rs1800497(T;T) individuals were significantly associated with all advanced adenoma recurrence (odds ratio 2.40, CI: 1.11-5.20).  The authors speculate this increased risk of adenoma recurrence (and an association with colorectal cancer) may be related to SNP-associated differences in alcohol and fat intake.A 2014 preliminary study links an individual's ANKK1 rs1800497 genotype as likely to experience greater positive subjective effects following cocaine exposure, including greater 'high' and 'like', and these individuals may have increased vulnerability to continue using cocaine or they may be at greater risk to relapse during periods of abstinence. The study states that replication of these findings is necessary to confirm these findings.SNPs rs6276, rs6277, and rs1800497) in the human DRD2 gene are associated with decreased D2R expression and function, as well as high blood pressure.  Data supports the hypothesis that D2R function has protective effects in human renal proximal tubule cells hRPTCs and suggest that carriers of these SNPs may be prone to chronic renal disease and high blood pressure.  SNPs, rs1800497 and rs2283265, located near and within the dopamine receptor 2 DRD2 gene, respectively, were significantly associated with improvements during working memory training (p < .003 and p < .0004, respectively).  A small (54 patient) study of patients with traumatic brain injury concluded that carriers of rs1800497(A) alleles recover slower as assessed by memory and attention tests./ 23andMe blog diminished pleasure response from food GENETICALLY DETERMINED DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING FROM ERRORSObsessive Compulsive DisorderAvoidance of ErrorsPostoperative Nausea and Vomiting  A variant in ANKK1 modulates acute subjective effects of cocaine: a preliminary study.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4816">rs10937823 is a SNP associated with the gene SORCS2, variants of which may play a role in bipolar disorder. The allele most frequently occurring is C, and the variant is T. In the HapMap-CEU population, CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 0.894, 0.097, and 0.009, respectively. However, in the HapMap-CHB population, CT was the most frequently expressed genotype; CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 0.366, 0.439, and 0.195, respectively. In some sample populations, the TT genotype did not exist (TSI, MKK, LWK, ASW).   dbSNPThe SORCS2 (sortillin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 2) gene on chromosome 4p16.1 is found to be highly expressed in the mature human brain and kidney. High levels of expression are also seen in the brain during mouse development.   GeneCards This gene family is responsible for trafficking lysosomal enzymes that are modified within the Golgi to their packaging vacuole.   Sortillins have been found to facilitate neurotrophin binding to its receptor, which is necessary for mediating neuronal apoptosis, growth and survival. Given these roles, it has been proposed that alterations to the SORCS2 gene can lead to neuronal dysfunction. In 2008, a genome-wide association study indicated the SORCS2 gene in bipolar disorder. The study conducted by Baum et al. analyzed 461 affected individuals and 563 matched controls (from the National Institutes of Mental Health Genetics Initiative, all of European ancestry), and a replication sample of 772 affected individuals and 876 matched controls (affected individuals recruited from German hospital admissions, and controls recruited from a German census). The C allele of rs10937823 was found at a frequency of 0.949 in cases and 0.912 in controls in NIMH cohort (p=0.001); 0.954 in cases and 0.931 in controls in the German cohort (p=0.004). The resulting combined odds ratio was 1.67 between the German and NIMH cohorts.  Table 3 Furthermore, with multi-locus analysis, the authors found that the highest risk of bipolar disorder was associated with presence of both rs10937823 and rs1170191, a SNP in diacylglycerol kinase eta (DGKH  Rs1170191), suggesting that these SNPs have a combinatorial effect in conferring risk (p=1.2x10-8). A Finnish bipolar family study in 2009 replicated the association between rs10937823 and bipolar disorder. The researchers genotyped the 26 SNPs most strongly associated SNPs as found by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, and the aforementioned study by Baum et al. in 723 individuals from 180 families. The study classified individuals as falling into diagnostic classes of bipolar type I disorder (cases = 214; controls = 509) or a broad mood spectrum disorder encompassing all types of bipolar disorder (cases = 298; controls = 495). In an opposite finding to that of Baum et al., the minor allele (T) frequency in the unaffected individuals was 0.999; in cases, the frequency was 0.112. The lower frequency of the T allele of rs10937823 in cases versus controls was statistically significant (p=0.004187 using broad mood spectrum disorder; p=0.004703 using broad mood spectrum disorder). In 2011, In a Japanese cohort of 736 individuals, rs10937823 was again found to be significantly associated with bipolar disorder by Takata et al. (363 cases, 370 controls; p=0.0175). However, the results showed that the risk allele (more commonly associated allele in cases) was T, not C. The minor allele frequency in the bipolar disorder sample was 0.275, versus 0.253 in the control sample. An odds ratio for this SNP was not reported. In 2011, Cristoforou et al. identified an association between rs10937823 and bipolar disorder in a Scottish population (506 cases, 607 controls; p=0.031; OR not reported). Like the Japanese study by Takata et al., the minor allele (T) was found to be associated with bipolar disease.   Similar observations of this &#8220;flip-flop&#8221; phenomenon where opposite alleles appear to confer risk have been reported in other genes, such as COMT gene and schizophrenia, and GSTO1 gene and age of onset in Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease. The authors suggest that such different results could be due to allelic heterogeneity, the effects of multiple loci, or varying linkage disequilibrium amongst the subjects, if the findings across the studies and populations are indeed correct.</p>

A 2008 article titled "Polymorphisms of the HNF1A gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha are associated with C-reactive protein" reported "results of two genetic-association studies of CRP, the Pharmacogenomics and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease (PARC) study and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)." They were unable to find association between this SNP and CRP levels, but said this lack of finding may be due to their smaller sample size.

The latter SNP genotype rs8192284 AA (major allele) carried a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (OD =1 in the lowest quartile of the sample, OR=5 in the highest quartile). ORs for AC+CC (C is the minor allele) ranged from 1 to 3.. Published 2011. In the analysis of 15,797 asthmatic patients and 42,003 controls, researchers found rs4129267 SNP's minor allele a risk for Asthma (OR 1·09, combined p=2·4×10(-8)). Published 2012. Stated "The SNP rs4129267 is in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 1) with the IL6R coding SNP rs2228145 (Asp(358)Ala).

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2516">rs1799945, also known as H63D or His63Asp, represents a SNP that accounts for a mild form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload condition in which mutations of certain genes involved in iron metabolism disrupt the body&#8217;s ability to regulate uptake of iron, causing increased intestinal iron absorption. The most common form is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which are inherited recessively. The gene for HH is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 . In 1996, HFE, a gene for HH, was found to have two missense mutations . A mutation at amino acid 282 (C282Y) was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH. This is a point mutation from guanine to adenine, resulting in a missense mutation from cysteine to tyrosine. Such mutations are commonly found in people with European ancestry, and is more rare in Asian and African populations. Among individuals of northern European descent, hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited identified genetic disorder. However, penetrance differs between different populations.==HFE Gene==The HFE gene encodes the human hemochromatosis protein, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 at 6p21.3. The protein regulates iron absorption by regulating the interaction of the transferrin receptor with transferrin. The HFE protein interacts with TFRC, the transferrin receptor protein 1, so its primary mode of action is through regulation of the iron storage hormone hepcidin.====Mutations in the HFE Gene====The three most common HH-causing mutations in the HFE gene (chromosome 6p21.3) are C282Y (A at rs1800562 instead of G), H63D (G at rs1799945 instead of C), and S65C (T at i3002468 instead of A). At least 17 other mutations in the HFE gene have been linked to HH. 60-90% of people with HH have two copies of the C282Y mutation. The H63D mutation is also quite common&#8212;about 20% of people carry a copy of the mutation, and about 3% have two copies. This mutation is not as severe as the C282Y mutation, and only causes symptoms when someone has both the H63D and the C282Y mutations. Even then, only a small fraction of people with one copy of each mutation actually exhibit evidence of iron overload. Additionally, those who have two copies of H63D do not exhibit any symptoms and are not at risk for iron overload. The S65C mutation is less common, and will also only cause symptoms if in combination with C282Y. For both H63D/C282Y and S65C/C282Y single mutation individuals, symptoms are usually mild if they develop at all.==Influence on Iron Levels==HH has four main pathophysiological mechanisms : the increased absorption of dietary iron in the upper intestine, 2) decreased expression of hepcidin, 3) altered function of the HFE protein, and 4) tissue injury and fibrogenesis induced by iron. Since the HFE gene encodes for proteins that affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis, this mechanism will be further explained in more detail. The HFE gene regulates the liver protein hepcidin, which is considered to be the principal iron-regulatory hormone. Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.==Symptoms of Hereditary Hemochromatosis==The symptoms of HH depend on the person&#8217;s mutation as well as their sex and diet. The older a person, the more likely iron has accumulated in the body over time. Typically, complications may develop later in life between the ages of 40 and 60 in men and in post-menopausal women. If symptoms do develop, these are typically seen in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and testes. At first, one may feel symptoms such as joint pain and stiffness, fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Later symptoms may lead to more serious conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, liver failure, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and arthritis.====Symptomatic Findings in Patients with HH==== Liver- hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver failure Joints- arthritis, swelling, chondrocalcinosis Heart- dilated cardiomyopathy, CHF Skin- increased pigmentation Endocrine- testicular atrophy, hypogonadism Hypothyroidism</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="186">A SNP in rs1229984 encodes a form of the alcohol dehydrogenase ADH1B gene that significantly reduces the clearance rate of alcohol from the liver. This SNP is also known as Arg48His, with the (G) allele corresponding to the Arg and the (A) to the His.Known in the literature as ADH2 2 or sometimes ADH1B 2, the allele with increased activity (meaning more rapid oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde) is His48, encoded by rs1229984(A). Individuals with one or especially two ADH2 2 alleles, ie genotypes rs1229984(A;G) or rs1229984(A;A) are more likely to find drinking unpleasant and have a somewhat reduced risk for alcoholism.  A study of over 3,800 cases of "upper aerodigestive" cancers (mouth/throat, voice box, and esophageal cancers) concluded that the rs1229984(A) allele (in dbSNP orientation) has a protective effect. Carriers of this allele had a 0.56x (decreased; p=10<sup>-10</sup>) risk of having one of these cancer types. A review of the (at times conflicting) findings regarding ADH1B genotypes and maternal and fetal alcohol syndromes is available. study of 4,500+ Australian twins concluded that rs1229984(G) carriers flush less after alcohol consumption, consumed alcohol on more occasions, had a higher maximum number of alcoholic drinks in a single day and had a higher overall alcohol consumption in the previous year than those with the less common (A) allele. The rs1229984(A;G) genotype might be associated with a decreased risk for migraine, and the rs1229984(A) allele may be related with the risk for triggering migraine attacks after alcohol consumption based on a study of 197 Spanish patients.Note: this is not the SNP associated with the "Asian Blush" (rs671), although there are several studies looking at individuals with varying combinations of SNPs rs671 and rs1229984.According to / a 23andMe discussion This is one of the SNPs which were re-analyzed April 2009.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1614">rs225014, also known as Thr92Ala, represents a variant in the deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II DIO2 gene on chromosome 14. In dbSNP orientation for this SNP, the more common (T) allele encodes the Thr (threonine) and the somewhat less common (C) allele encodes the Ala (alanine) at this position in the DIO2 protein.Polymorphisms in this SNP have associations with various conditions in the literature: osteoarthritis, psychological disorders, reduced thyroid hormone metabolism, Type 2 diabetes, and various other conditions.==Osteoarthritis== A 2012 article titled "Increased type II deiodinase protein in OA-affected cartilage and allelic imbalance of OA risk polymorphism rs225014 at DIO2 in human OA joint tissues" identified that the minor 'C' allele was associated with a significant, 1.3-fold higher risk of osteoarthritis (OA) relative to the 'T' allele. A 2008 article titled "Identification of DIO2 as a new susceptibility locus for symptomatic osteoarthritis" explained that "Confirmation and replication by association in the additional osteoarthritis studies indicated a common DIO2 haplotype, exclusively containing the minor allele of rs225014 and common allele of rs12885300, with a combined recessive odds ratio of 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-2.34 with P = 2.02 x 10(-5) in female cases with advanced/symptomatic hip osteoarthritis." (Abstract)==Psychological disorders==. Published 2015. Abstract stated "The specific variant of the DIO2 gene, namely the CC genotype of the Thr92Ala polymorphism, was more frequently found in healthy subjects than in patients with depression, what suggests that it could potentially serve as a marker of a lower risk for recurrent depressive disorder. The distribution of four haplotypes was also significantly different between the two study groups with the TC (Thr-Gly) haplotype more frequently detected in patients with depression." (Abstract). Published 2009. This study analyzed "(ORFa)-Gly3Asp (rs12885300) and Thr92Ala (rs225014) with potential functions on the activity of DIO2." Findings in abstract: "Both SNPs were significantly higher in the BPAD (Bipolar disorder) patients, with odds ratios of 1.489 ... and 1.616 ... respectively. Individuals with two copies of the variant 3Gly or 92Ala were at greater risk of BPAD.... Haplotypes ORFa-3Asp-92Ala and ORFa-3Gly-92Ala indicated higher susceptibility for BPAD with odds ratios of 3.759 (95% CI=2.013-7.020) and 1.292 (95% CI=1.017-1.642), respectively, while ORFa-3Asp-92Thr probably played a protective role with an odds ratio of 0.395 (95% CI=0.284-0.549)." (Abstract)==Thyroid hormone metabolism and treatment for hypothyroidism==. According to a 2009 study of 500 patients, hypothyroid patients on LT4 (Levothyroxine) therapy who don't show much improvement may have lower brain thyroid levels (not reflected in their serum levels) correlated to the number of rs225014(C) alleles they carry, and these patients may benefit from combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy.  "The Thr92AlaD2 Polymorphism May Play a Novel Role in Hypothyroidism" by Elizabeth A McAninch, Antonio C Bianco, US Endocrinology, 2015;11(2):92–4 DOI: . This article stated "A prevalent polymorphism in D2, Thr92AlaD2, has been associated with improved well-being on “combination therapy” with T4+T3; the underlying mechanism is unclear as T4-to-T3 conversion appears normal. Novel studies indicate this might be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. If the relationship between Thr92AlaD2-expression and treatment preference is confirmed, personalized medicine may play a role in hypothyroidism." (Abstract)However, as of 2016, controversy continued about the value of testing for and treating polymorphisms of this SNP.  See the liothyronine page for further references.==Type 2 Diabetes==. Published 2010. Published 2011.  Abstract stated "Patients carrying D2 Ala/Ala genotype had a higher fasting plasma insulin and HOMA(IR) index as compared to patients carrying Thr/Ala or Thr/Thr genotypes (P = 0.022 and P = 0.001, respectively). A significant synergistic effect was observed between D2 Thr92Ala and PPARγ2 Pro12Ala polymorphisms on HOMA(IR) index, with carriers of both D2 Ala/Ala genotype and PPARγ2 Ala12 allele showing the highest HOMA(IR) values, after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, and use of medication for DM2 (P = 0.010)." ==Various conditions==. Published 2011. Abstract stated: "The G (Ala) allele of the Thr92Ala coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs225014) was protective in severe sepsis and severe sepsis-associated ALI after adjustments for age, sex, and genetic ancestry in a logistic regression model in European Americans." .

PMID 17200669, PMID 17435756In another recent (2007) report, rs2241880 is confirmed to be associated with both Crohn's disease and ileal disease, but additionally, the authors calculate risk for individuals who are homozygotes for this SNP plus 2 others (in the IBD5 and NOD2 genes). Individuals homozygous for the risk alleles for all 3 of these SNPs are estimated to be at 20 fold higher risk (CI ~9-49) for Crohn's disease.  From the largest most recent survey, the Crohn's disease-associated SNPs for IBD5 and NOD2 are, respectively, rs6596075 and rs17221417.  associated With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases but Not With Celiac Diseasers11209026 had a protective effect for IBD in the case-control analysis (odds ratio OR 0.19, 95% confidence interval CI 0.10-0.37, P= 6.6E-09).

The rs1982073(T) allele, generally associated with lower levels of TGFB1 protein production, has been associated with increased risk for the following: Allograft rejection   The rs1982073(T) allele is associated with increased risk for subclinical allograft rejection with an odds ratio of 6.7 (p = 0.02).  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)   Although smoking is the main risk factor, smokers with a rs1982073(T) allele (or two other TGFB1 SNPs, rs2241712 and rs1800469) were more likely to develop COPD, based on a study of ~700 Caucasian subjects.  Cytopenia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  rs1982073(T;T) homozygosity was associated with a severe degree of cytopenia (odds ratio 4.9, p = 0.0071) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), even though the genotype apparently does not predispose individuals to the disease.  Diabetes  A study of 400 Caucasians with type 1 diabetes found an increased risk for diabetic nephropathy for carriers of rs1982073(T) alleles.  Pre-eclampsia and stillbirth  Although not associated with the overall risk, among women who developed eclampsia/pre-eclampsia with severe renal and neurological complications or had neonatal deaths/still births, the rs1982073(T) allele was more likely in a relatively small study (< 100 patients).  Sarcoidosis and chronic beryllium disease  Although not associated with overall risk for developing the diseases, the rs1982073(T) allele was associated with the severity of granulomatous diseases such as chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and sarcoidosis, and a haplotype containing rs1982073(C) was protective against severe disease. On the other hand (strand?), the less common rs1982073(C) allele, generally associated with lower levels of TGFB1 protein production, has been associated with increased risk as follows: The rs1982073(C) allele was significantly more frequent in patients with two Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-related diseases, specifically, primary acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH), than in controls (p<0.001).  Alzheimer's disease  Both the rs1982073(C) allele and the (C;C) genotype were overrepresented in a study of ~200 patients compared to controls, independently of ApoE4 status. The (C;C) genotype was also overrepresented in patients progressing from MCI (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's, suggesting that TGFB1 may be an early marker of inflammatory mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's.  Brucellosis  A study of ~400 Iranian patients with brucellosis found that the rs1982073(C) allele was associated with increased risk.  Diabetes  A study of 400 Caucasians with type-2 diabetes determined that rs1982073(C) was associated with diabetic nephropathy, and even more strongly with diabetic retinopathy; the odds ratio patients with retinopathy but not nephropathy versus uncomplicated diabetes was 3.17 (CI: 2.17-4.63), and the different results between type-2 diabetes and type-1 diabetes were potentially ascribed to population differences.  Myopia  A study of 200 highly nearsighted Chinese Taiwanese found that people with the rs1982073(C;C) genotype were more likely to have high myopia compared to the (C;T) or (T;T) genotypes. The odds ratio was 1.83 (CI: 1.27-2.63, p<0.001).  Prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)  The rs1982073(C) allele was associated with a higher risk of developing prostate cancer as well as benign  prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a study of 175 Brazilian patients, with odds ratio compared to the population of 2.6x and 3.6x, respectively.  Ulcer  The rs1982073(C) allele was associated with risk for gastric ulcer with an odds ratio of 1.76 (CI: 1.12-2.77) in a study of 377 Russian patients.  Patients homozygous for rs1982073(C) were at greatest risk (odds ratio 7.7, p=0.03) for graft versus host disease (GVD) after heart transplantation.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3165">rs2279744, a variant in the promoter of the MDM2 gene and also known as "-410T-G", "SNP309", and "SNP309T>G", has been studied for several years to determine it's role in cancer origin and treatment. The interest primarily stems from the ability of the MDM2 protein to bind to and thereby enhance the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein known as p53. Studies on rs2279744 include:  rs2279744(G) carriers in individuals with cancer tend to develop such cancers on average 12 years earlier than those lacking this allele, and the frequency of rs2279744(G) was greatly increased in those who developed soft tissue sarcomas at a young age.   Individuals with one or more rs2279744(G) alleles who are also carriers of the TP53 rs1042522(C) (arg at aa72) SNP tend to develop cancers earlier than rs2279744(T;T) homozygotes who carry the same p53 SNP.   rs2279744(T;T) individuals who have a mutant p53 (in their tumors) are at an increased risk of death (risk ratio RR of death = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.08 to 5.03). Tumor p53 status was not associated with breast cancer survival among rs2279744(G;T) or rs2279744(G;G) genotypes.   rs2279744 showed no association with nonsmall cell lung cancer risk in a study of 1,787 Caucasian patients. However, a possible association between nonsmoking (G;G) homozygotes and a higher risk of nonsmall cell lung cancer was reported.  A study in Chinese leukemia patients found that the rs2279744(G) allele was unexpectedly associated with reduced risk.  Another study concludes that this SNP on its own has little or no effect on the risk of common cancers, but it might modify the time of tumor onset and prognosis.   rs2279744(G;G) females are at a 2.76x increased risk (CI: 1.06-7.20, p=0.03) for endometrial cancer compared to (G;T) or (T;T) genotypes based on a study of 73 patients and matched controls.  A study of 148 individuals with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing first-line chemotherapy, such as the irinotecan plus cisplatin regimen, concluded after multivariate analysis that the rs2279744(T;T) genotype was independently predictive for longer survival (HR = 1.742, p = .032).   The rs2279744(G;G) genotype was associated with high grade breast cancer tumors (with an odds ratio of 1.64, CI:1.06-2.53, p=0.025) and greater nodal involvement (OR=2.51, CI:1.26-4.98, p=0.009), but was not associated with an earlier age of cancer diagnosis or even risk of breast cancer, in a study of ~300 Scottish Caucasian patients.  Around 300 cases each of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma were studied relative to this SNP. No significant associations were found between rs2279744 and any of these three types of skin cancer. However, compared with the (T;T) genotype, the adjusted odds ratios of having moles on the arms for (G;T) and (G;G) genotypes was 0.92 (CI: 0.78-1.08) and 0.68 (CI: 0.53-0.87), respectively (p, trend, 0.005).  rs2279744(G;G) women are diagnosed with melanoma 13 years earlier than women who carry one or no G alleles. Note that this SNP does not cause higher risk of melanoma; it affects only the age at diagnosis of melanoma in women and has no effect in men, as reported in the 23andMe blog / 23andMe blog.  Odds ratio for (G;G) 3x, for (G;T) 2x, for breast cancer in a study of 124 Taiwanese patients, along with a correlation towards earlier occurence.  rs117039649, also known as SNP285C, a second MDM2 SNP found on the SNP305G allele (and only in Caucasians), reduces the risk of both ovarian and breast cancer among SNP309G holders (odds ratio 0.74 and 0.79, respectively), compared to SNP309G holders lacking this (second) SNP./ 23andMe blog rs2279744(G) has been associated with earlier onset for some cancers, including soft tissue sarcoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in women, and decreased survival in people with stomach and kidney cancer.  But there is evidence for improved survival in women with ovarian cancer who have the G version of this SNP.  Paradoxically, higher levels of the MDM2 protein (as would be expected with the G version of SNP rs2279744 shown to lead to earlier melanoma onset in the current study) have been associated with improved survival for melanoma.  rs2279744 is not associated with SLE in a study of Caucasians, African-Americans, and Asian children and adults.  rs2279744, rs1042522, rs17878362 and rs1625895 associated with high grade endometrial cancer</p>

    [[ID:q1451]]
    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1451">rs1799853 is a SNP in the CYP2C9 gene and is linked to poor warfarin metabolism and risk of GI bleeding with some NSAID drugs. The common nomenclature for this polymorphism is CYP2C9 2 (Cys amino acid, T allele; the SNP is also known as C430T or Cys144Arg). Advanced knowledge of this may influence initial warfarin dosing by physicians. Warfarin is monitored through INR (international normalized ratio) and proper dosing is influenced by a variety of factors including warfarin metabolism and diet.  The rs1799853(T) allele encodes a variant amino acid, cysteine, which has been linked to poor metabolism of warfarin and thus sensitivity. The CYP2C9 2 allele is also associated with higher sensitivity to the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin. Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) mention concurrent testing for the HLA-B 15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN). The effect of CYP2C9 variants on drug metabolism should not be predicted without also considering CYP2C9 3, defined as the common loss of function variant rs1057910(C)  (NM_000771:c.430C>T, NP_000762:p.144R>C) /. In a 2009 article titled "Genetically based impairment in CYP2C8- and CYP2C9-dependent NSAID metabolism as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding: is a combination of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics required to improve personalized medicine?" Authors reviewed prior research that argued: Individuals carrying minor alleles of this both CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 AND CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) have increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib.  In addition, carriers of the risk allele for CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 have decreased metabolism of Ibuprofen, Flurbiprofen, Piroxicam, and Tenoxicam.   The presence of CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 allele alone does not confer risk with Diclofenac, but when it is combined with CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080), Diclofenac induces hepatoxicity and confers risk of GI bleeding.    In a 2008 article (reviewed in ) titled "Interaction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes modifies the risk for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related acute gastrointestinal bleeding," the study discovered that carriers of CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a GI bleeding event risk OR=1.81 (95% CI=0.95–3.46; P=0.071) and risk increased if carriers drank more than 20g alcohol/day to an OR=1.99 (95% CI=1.06–3.74; P=0.034). As CYP2C8 3 and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium, patients are likely to carry the risk allele to both 8 3 and 9 2, and when they do, The OR (95% CI) for carriers of such a genotype is increased to 1.94 (1.13–3.33), P=0.017.   A 2013 NIH review titled "PharmGKB summary: very important pharmacogene information for cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8" reiterated that "some data suggest that the combined presence of minor risk alleles CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080) and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 is a determinant of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding."
