        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="111">rs2052129, also known as (G4586T), is a variant in the AOC1 diamine oxidase gene on chromosome 7. The minor allele, rs2052129(A), has been reported in a 2011 study to be associated with decreased transcriptional activity, at least when measured in homozygotes (for the minor allele) compared to major allele homozygotes. However, the same study describing the decreased gene activity reported that this variant was not associated with histamine intolerance (HIT), suggesting that the variant may be necessary but not sufficient (on its own) to lead to actual HIT.No association between the promoter SNP rs2052129 and the risk of developing NSAID hypersensitivity was seen in a 2012 study of 442 Caucasian patients.A different 2012 study of ~300 patients with selective NSAID hypersensitivity found no association for rs2052129; however, they reported that logistic regression analyses suggested that rs2052129(C;C) homozygotes were related to selective hypersensitivity to ibuprofen.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4936">While the ApoE4 allele (rs429358(C)) is widely accepted as the predominant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, there are likely to be numerous other factors, both genetic and environmental, associated to lesser degrees with susceptibility to the disease. Genes influencing the immune system, and in particular susceptibility to viral infections such as herpes, may be among such factors. This SNP, located in the TAP2 gene and thus implicated in the activation of HIV and HSV-1 viruses, is seen more commonly in ~300 Alzheimer patients than in the same number of controls. The risk allele is rs241448(C). The odds ratio is reported to be 2.14 (CI: 1.02-2.55) for rsrs241448(C;C) homozygotes, and 1.51 (CI: 0.80-1.93) for rsrs241448(C;T) heterozygotes, compared with rsrs241448(T;T) homozygotes.

The (G) allele is rare, usually being found in just under 1% of allele counts, but Bartter syndrome appears to be even rarer. This implies that the (G) allele may not be fully causative or penetrant, and more recently (as of ~2015) two labs are reporting in ClinVar that they believe this variant is benign. Anecdotally, we (SNPedia) have also heard from an rs59172778(G;G) individual who has no signs of Bartter syndrome.So while it remains possible that the rs59172778(G) allele is a very weakly penetrant mutation associated with Bartter syndrome as originally reported, the preponderance of evidence is now indicating it is a benign polymorphism.</p>

In general, the insertion genotype ("2G/2G") is reported to lead to higher transcriptional activity of this gene, leading potentially to higher levels or rates of collagen breakdown.In a study of ~200 breast cancer patients, those with rs1799750(G;G) genotype, i.e. also known as the "2G/2G" genotype, had increased frequency of lymph node metastasis and thus a poorer prognosis. The odds ratio for mixed ethnicities was 3.9 (CI: 1.7-9.4, p=0.001), and when calculated only for Caucasians, 2.6 (CI: 1.0-6.9, p=0.06).Subsequently, a 2012 meta-analysis based on about 10,000 cancer cases, half of which metastasized, concluded that 2G/2G genotypes had a slightly higher overall risk of metastasis (OR = 1.44 for homozygous minor, CI: 1.05-1.98). no influence on varicose veins</p>

More information about this mutation can be found in OMIM  104311.0010.This SNP is referred to as i5047571 by 23andMe, and it is reported to assay the A/G form of this SNP (and not the A/C). Washington Post article on the history, traces the presence of this to a 17th century conquistador.</p>

Homozygotes for the rare "A" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.12) were 1.8 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common "G" allele.   They did not replicate association between rs6602024 and obesity-related traits in the GenNet sample, although they found that in European Americans, Hispanic Americans and African Americans, homozygotes for the rare "A" allele where, on average, 1.0 - 3.0 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the more common "G" allele.Furthermore, a study of 18,000 Danish subjects also failed to find any direct role for this SNP in the development of obesity. Genome-wide association scans identified CTNNBL1 as a novel gene for obesity. Tests for candidate-gene interaction for longitudinal quantitative traits measured in a large cohort.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1403">Note that this SNP is unusual in at least two regards. First, it is defined in both dbSNP and here in SNPedia (currently at least) as being on the minus strand, even though the vast majority of its fellow CYP21A2 gene SNPs are defined on the plus strand. The literature and most (other) databases define this SNP based on the plus strand.Second, there are three alleles for this SNP; as defined on the minus strand, there are plenty of individuals walking around with rs6467(G) and rs6467(T) alleles, both of which lead to fully functional 21-hydroxylase (the enzyme encoded by the CYP21A2 gene), and there are also some individuals carrying a rs6467(C) allele, which severely reduces enzyme activity.The rs6467(T) polymorphism defines the CYP21A2 1B allele according to the  CYP21A2 Nomenclature table. The allele with impaired function, rs6467(C), is the CYP21A2 9 allele.See further details at congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</p>

The HLA-DRB1 1501 allele is fairly common; for example, it occurs in 15-30% of individuals of Northern European ancestry. / PMC2892470An interesting series of correlations have been woven together to suggest that a possible way to lower the risk of rs3135388(T) carriers developing multiple sclerosis would be to ensure sufficient vitamin D production, presumably through sunlight exposure, during as yet unknown critical periods in development. / PMC2892470 A major histocompatibility Class I locus contributes to multiple sclerosis susceptibility independently from HLA-DRB1 15:01.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="673">rs41293463 is a SNP causing an amino acid change in the breast cancer 1 BRCA1 gene at amino position 841. The more common rs41293463(C) allele encodes Arg, while the rare rs41293463(T) allele encodes Trp; this SNP is also known as R841W.A 1996 study of 305 cases in Southern California of breast cancer and ovarian cancer found 3 cases carrying the rs1800709(T) allele. In all three cases, there was a strong family history of breast, ovarian, or other cancers, and family members showed a high concordance of cancer incidence with the presence of this SNP. However, the age of cancer onset was the same as for sporadic cases. The authors conclude that this SNP may explain around 1% (CI: 0-1.7%) of all breast and ovarian cancers, at least for this population. Note: this SNP is rather unlikely to be a causative or high penetrance mutation, given it's frequency in the population at large.  See also  Omim 113705.0022</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="229">rs699 is a SNP in the angiotensin AGT gene that encodes a functional change. In most published literature, the name for this SNP is M235T, or perhaps Met235Thr, however its amino acid 268 (not 235) that varies based on the numbering in todays databases. rs699 is also occasionally known as C4072T.In any case, the rs699(C) allele encodes the threonine variant, which is associated with higher plasma angiotensin levels, and ultimately higher blood pressure leading to increased risk for hypertension associated disorders.This association was first reported in 1992 , and many studies, though not all, have replicated these findings.rs699 is also (generally) reported to be in tight linkage with rs5051, a neighboring SNP in the promoter of the AGT gene.rs699(C) has also been implicated as a risk allele in at least two Caucasian populations for pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-induced hypertension)PMID 8513325, PMID 8348146 but did not present a risk in one African population .

For details of all 25 SNPs in this group, along with the two methods used to calculate overall risk estimates for breast cancer, refer to the SNPedia breast cancer entry.For this particular SNP, the risk (minor) allele is (G), encoding the His; the SNP is also known as N372H or Asn372His.In a separate study, rs144848(G;G) homozygotes were determined to have a 1.31x increased risk (CI: 1.07-1.61) for breast cancer greater risk compared to (T;T) genotypes. Interestingly, in normal females of all ages there is a significant deficiency of homozygotes compared with that expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, whereas in males there is an excess of homozygotes (with an estimated fitness of 0.82 in females and 1.38 in males). This implies that rs144848 affects fetal survival in a sex-dependent manner.   See also  Omim 113705.0013</p>

The (G) variant indicates the presence of a non-wild type CYP2D6 variant, but it appears in many different variants so it can not be used to determine the presence of any particular variant.The rs1080985(G) allele defines the CYP2D6 2A variant, which has been reported to have relatively normal function yet in some cases may also lead to the intermediate metabolism phenotype.Please be careful when interpreting results for this SNP as it is in dbSNP and SNPedia in minus orientation where the risk allele is G, but test results are usually in plus orientation where the risk allele is C.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3157">Also known as "C/T(-13915)", and located in the MCM6 gene but with influence on the lactase LCT gene, rs4988235 is one of several SNPs that is associated with the primary haplotype associated with hypolactasia, more commonly known as lactose intolerance in Arab Bedouin populations. In Arabia, lactase persistence (LP) is associated with tion -13,915 G and not, as in Europe, with -13,910 T or, as in Africa, with -13,907 G and -14,010 C. We show here that, in Arabia, -13,915 G frequency conforms to a partial clinal pattern and that this specific mutation has likely been spread from Arabia to Africa only recently from the sixth century AD onward by nomadic Arabs (Bedouins) looking for new pastures. Arabic populations in Africa that still maintain a nomadic way of life also have more -13,915 G variants and fewer sub-Saharan L-type mitochondrial DNA haplogroups; this observation matches archaeological and historical records suggesting that the migration of Arabic pastoralists was accompanied by gradual sedentarization that allowed for admixture with the local African population.

A study of patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the uterine cervix, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), and breast cancer found 1.5x-2x increased risk for all three cancer types for the rs3738579(T;T) genotype, while finding decreased risk (0.5x) for rs3738579(C;T) heterozygotes. rs3738579(C;C) homozygotes had 0.6x less risk for cervical cancer but increased risk for HNSCC (1.4x) and breast cancer (1.8x). Although statistics were not reported per genotype, a combination of data from all three cancer forms over all genotypes provided strong statistical evidence for rs3738579 as a cancer marker, with a p-value of 4.43x10(-5).Note that the research cited above was published over a decade ago, and there has been no follow-up or replication to our knowledge.

The confidence interval is wide indicating a small number of positives in the subpopulation, maybe one or two, and the paper had more than sixteen tests with no adjustment of p-values, which makes the test non-definitive (hence small magnitude).</p>

This information is reflected in ClinVar, which lists this variant as pathogenic (albeit in an unreviewed status).The variant appears to be too common to be causative though. In  ExAC, it was counted 13149 times out of 115732  alleles, leading to a MAF of 0.11, and other databases generally agree with a MAF of up to 0.15.If you are aware of additional evidence concerning the potential pathogenicity of this variant, please let us know.23andMe refers to a SNP at this position as i5001397, however, they indicate it assays an A and a C (as represented on the plus strand). Since neither A nor C is the major allele, which would be a G as represented on the plus strand, it's unclear if this is a technical and/or database error of some sort.</p>

One copy of of rs1800407(A) is sufficient for this effect. PMID 12163334, PMID 15889046;  OMIM 203200.0012 According to tree scanning analysis, the proportion of eye colour variation explained by this nucleotide position is merely 4%. Thus, additional variation present in the OCA2 gene and perhaps some other pigment related genes must be taken into account in order to explain the high phenotypic variation in iris colour. Among rs12913832(A;A) individuals, the penetrance for green/hazel eyes was 50%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, for rs1800407(A;A), (A;G), and (G;G) genotypes, respectively.

In contrast to most BRCA mutations, which are considered tumor suppressors and functionally recessive, this ATM mutation is considered a dominant negative, since loss of the wild-type allele in tumors with the ATM mutation is not consistently observed.Note that the confidence intervals are quite large, so although the relative risk is calculated as increasing eight-fold, the authors cited indicate that they can only state with 95% confidence that the "true" increase in relative risk lies somewhere between 2.8 and 22.5.Somewhat similarly, a 2016 publication study involving 42,000 breast cancer cases concluded that rs28904921(G) carriers had an odds ratio of 11 (CI:1.4-85; p=0.0012) and a 52% (CI: 28-80%) chance of developing the disease by age 70.</p>

The more common rs429358 allele is (T). If the allele is (C) and the same chromosome also harbors the rs7412(C) allele, the combination is known as an APOE-ε4 allele. The APOE-ε4 allele has a strong influence on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Many studies have estimated the level of risk, and it varies depending on age, sex, ethnicity, and other factors. One meta-analysis estimated the odds ratios for homozygous rs429358(C;C) individuals compared to the more common ApoE3/ApoE3 homozygotes to be 12x for late-onset Alzheimer's and 61x for early-onset disease. Meta-analyses have also supported the association between the APOE-ε4 allele and somewhat increased risk for heart disease, with an odds ratio of 1.42 (CI: 1.26 - 1.61).Note: Although ApoE status is technically defined by these two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412, a SNP in the adjacent ApoC1 gene, rs4420638, is co-inherited with ApoE and thus often - though not completely - predictive of it.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1884">rs2251746 is a SNP in the gene encoding the alpha chain of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FCER1A) on chromosome 1q23. High levels of serum IgE are associated with allergies, and are mediators of autoimmune diseases.An examination of over 11,000 Germans led to the conclusion that rs2251746 (and one other FCER1A SNP, the tightly linked rs2427837) were strongly associated with high levels of serum IgE. The more common (T) allele was associated with higher serum IgE, and the effect appeared to be additive. Therefore, homozygous rs2251746(C;C) individuals may be at lower risk for atopic eczema and asthma than carriers of one or two (T) alleles. In Japanese patients, rs2251746 may be a poor predictor, and the neighboring rs2427827 may be more appropriate.

Note that POAG is typically considered a disorder that is recessively inherited, and that the age of onset is known to be quite variable even for a given single mutation.A functional study in 2008 concluded that this mutation (the Y81N variant) should be considered a hypomorphic allele rather than a mutation, since the enzymatic activity of corresponding protein was in between that of a classic CYP1B1 mutant and that of a normal protein.More recently, the variant has been categorized as benign in ClinVar. In ExAC, it is clearly a rare variant, with an average minor allele frequency of 0.006, but showing the highest frequency in Finnish European populations (0.04).Overall, the significance of this variant is unclear.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3575">rs5065, also known as T2238C, is a SNP in the atrial natriuretic precursor A NPPA gene.A large study has been conducted in which 42,418 hypertensive participants 55 or older were followed for several years while on one of four medications: a diuretic, a calcium antagonist, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or an alpha-blocker. The primary endpoint was either fatal heart disease or a heart attack.The blood pressure after six months of rs5065(G;G) patients (note: genotype is in dbSNP orientation, not as published) was lower if the patients were treated with diuretics compared to other medications, with smaller variation seen for (A;A) genotypes. The authors noted that none of the findings retained statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons, but since the trend held in five of seven outcomes, they felt the results were nonetheless worth reporting. In summary, rs5065(G) allele carriers were better off (i.e. experienced more favorable cardiovascular disease outcomes) if treated with the diuretic (in this case, chlorthalidone), whereas rs5065(A;A) carriers were better off if treated with the calcium channel blocker (in this case, amlodipine).</p>

See below for another rs-identifier denoting this mutation.This mutation is well known but actually quite rare in most populations; for example, out of 120,000 alleles counted (from ~60,000 people) by  ExAC, it was seen only about 30 times (i.e. it was present in one copy in about 30 of those 60,000 people), leading to an allele frequency of 0.00024, or, to put it another way, to being present in only about 1 out of every 2,000 people. note: in ExAC, this mutation is correctly listed as occurring at GRCh37 position 17:41276044 as an ACT/A variant; however, the rs-id/SNP designation is incorrect in ExAC.Because of a natural dinucleotide repeat right where this mutation occurs, rs796856605 represents the same deletion of two bases, and therefore the same mutation, as rs386833395. Formerly (being being merged into rs386833395) this SNP was also known as rs796856605.This 185delAG mutation is considered a founder mutation among Ashkenazi Jews.rs386833395 as well as rs796856605 are referred to as i4000377 by 23andMe.</p>

These heterozgotes are reported to improve better over time in response to corticosteroid treatment for asthma than the rs2240017(G;G) homozygotes. So far, studies have not linked, however, this SNP to any change in the overall risk of asthma itself. Although the effect observed was strong, in that treating rs2240017(C;G) heterozygotes ultimately (over 4 years) yields average airway responsiveness in the normal range (i.e. in the same range as for nonasthmatics), the authors point out that the relatively small number of heterozygous children studied indicates that a larger study is warranted to ensure reproducibility. It is also unknown whether the effect is limited to the particular corticosteroid used (budesonide, aka Rhinocort) in this study. This is thought to be unlikely, though, given the general nature of the drug.</p>

A 2019 study  reported that that a carrier of a pathogenic PSEN1 mutation, known to cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease, who was also a homozygous ApoE3ch carrier, did not show cognitive symptoms before her seventies, almost three decades after expected onset. Autosomal dominant forms of Alzheimer's disease and sporadic Alzheimer's disease show largely similar pathogenesis. Likewise, common APOE alleles(ApoE-ε2, ApoE-ε3, and ApoE-ε4) have similar effects in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (, ApoE-ε4 carriers have earlier onset, ApoE-ε2 alleles have later onset). Together, this these findings suggest that being a homozygous ApoE-ε3ch carrier will potentially also convey protection against sporadic Alzheimer's disease.

Authors cited a 2005 study () that "demonstrated the presence of TSHR mRNA in human osteoblast cell lines."  A 2011 article "Genetics of thyroid function and disease" reviewed past research. Genome-wide association studies have not shown SNPs in TSHR such as rs1991517 to be associated with TSH concentrations at a high level of significance, but together with two other SNPs in other genes, (PDE8B rs4704397 and  CAPZB rs10917469, the three SNPs may account for "4.5% of the variation in TSH concentrations." TSHR gene SNPs have not been associated with T3 and T4 thyroid hormone levels, while deiodinase genes such as DIO1 rs2235544 have been associated with them.

More recent analyses have concluded that the rs61735045(A) allele is quite likely to actually be benign. A 2009 publication found that the frequency of the 530S allele was similar (about 5%) in all groups of people they studied, whether healthy or EDS-affected. Furthermore, the predicted homozygote minor frequency of 1 in 400 people is much higher than that of classical EDS. More recently, ExAC analysis shows an allele frequency of 3.5%, and a minor homozygote frequency of about 1 in 1000, which is still an order of magnitude or more higher than the estimated EDS incidence, incidating that either this allele is benign or the penetrance of even a double mutation is quite low.Additionally, as of 2014, two labs are reporting in ClinVar this variant as benign. In summary, the majority of current evidence indicates that the rs61735045 variant is likely to be benign.</p>

Specifically, although 1 in 300 uninfected people were reported to carry the (C;C) genotype, in the hospitalized patients the frequency was 1 in 17.; see also  MedPageHowever, in subsequent studies of more than 5000 subjects in two separate cohorts the association between the rs12252(C) polymorphism and the severity of H1N1 influenza could not be established, although there was a susceptibility to mild infection.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2575">rs17244841, also known as SNP 12, is located in the HMG-CoA reductase HMGCR gene. The protein encoded by this gene is the target for drugs designed to inhibit its action, in order to lower cholesterol levels. SNPs in the HMGCR gene may affect how well such drugs (typically statins) work.In a study of ~1,500 patients treated with 40mg/d of pravastatin, rs17244841(A;T) heterozgyotes had a mean decrease in total cholesterol of &#226;&#8364;&#8220;32.8 mg/dL (&#226;&#8364;&#8220;0.85 mmol/L), while the mean change for rs17244841(A;A) homozygotes was &#226;&#8364;&#8220;42.0 mg/dL (&#226;&#8364;&#8220;1.09 mmol/L), a reduction in overall efficacy of 21.8% (absolute difference, 9.2 mg/dL, CI: 3.8-14.6 mg/dL, p=.001). The drop in total cholesterol was almost completely due to the decrease in LDL cholesterol, as there was no significant difference in the change in HDL cholesterol with pravastatin between genotypes.This SNP is in tight linkage (r<sup>2</sup>>0.90) with another, rs17238540, so practically speaking, they are equivalent to each other.</p>

This SNP was also part of a haplotype (including rs12919501, rs4075942, and rs7190768) linked to violent crime. The authors point out state that more than 20 studies have found associations between CDH13 - although not this specific SNP - and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, schizophrenia, substance abuse or bipolar disorder. They also point out that given a population frequency of over 15% for this allele, compared to orders of magnitude lower frequencies of violent crime, the specificity and sensitivity of using this SNP to would be far "too low for any screening purposes, either for primary or secondary prevention of violent offending".In the same study, the low-activity form of the MAOA gene was also associated with extreme violent crime. In SNPedia, the proxy SNP for this variant is rs909525. The odds ratio associated with extreme violent crime for combined homozygosity for low-activity MAOA (i.e. rs909525(G;G)) and rs11649622(A;A) was 13.45 (95% CI 3.86&#8211;46.94; no p value stated).</p>

These proteins are expressed in many cell types, with roles in cell-cycle control, metabolism, regulatory T cell development and apoptosis. It's role in cytokine production appears to be the key factor in this SNP's association with disease prognosis (but, interestingly, no role in disease susceptibility has been found to date).rs12212067(G), the minor allele, is connected to the downregulation of TNF and several other proinflammatory cytokines in response to various antigens, and, the upregulation of IL10, a cytokine associated with anti-inflammatory effects. As elucidated in the cited study, this appears to explain the better outcomes for rs12212067(G) carriers of treatment for two auto-immune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. As might be predicted for an infectious disease relying on an upregulated inflammatory response (which isn't happening as much with these carriers), this also leads to worse outcomes for carriers afflicted with malaria.; More recently, a different group of researchers have reported that, at least in the patients they studied, rs12212067 is a far weaker predictor of the clinical outcome for Crohn's disease patients than is rs2066847, a SNP in the NOD2 gene.</p>

These types of proteins are involved in detoxification and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The rs283413(G) allele is the more common, encoding the amino acid glycine (Gly); the quite rare rs283413(T) allele encodes the variant stop codon (X). Originally identified in three Swedish patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), a study of ~1000 PD patients vs. ~1000 controls indicated an odds ratio for the risk allele of 3.25 (CI:1.31-8.05). This risk is effectively for heterozygotes, since the risk allele is so rare that no homozygotes for it were observed. In a study of 40 index cases, 10% were found to harbor the rs283413(T) risk allele. On its own, this SNP is also said to explain 9.0% of the variability in the rate at which alcohol is metabolized, based on a study of 250 Spaniards. More significantly (in a statistical sense), this study concluded that combinations of this SNP and others were shown to affect alcohol metabolism; most of these combinations are represented by the gs211 genoset. Note that the effects of alcohol are higher in individuals who break down (basically, detoxify) ethanol more slowly.</p>

An allele that encodes either a blood group type A or type B will have a (G) at this SNP site, i.e. such an allele will be rs8176719(G). If a one-base deletion has occured at this site, removing this nucleotide all together, the corresponding allele is considered to be rs8176719(-) and encodes the most common blood group type O allele.  However, an individual will typically only be blood group type O if they are carry two copies of (are homozygous) for this deletion, in other words, if their genotype is rs8176719(-;-). If they carry one copy, they could be blood type A, or blood type B (but are unlikely to be type O). A person who is rs8176719(G;G) is likely to be of blood type A, B, or AB, but due to the existence of (rare) nonfunctional O alleles brought about by (nondeletional) mutations at other positions than rs8176719, they could at least theoretically still be phenotyped as type O.The determination of blood group types A, B, and AB through SNP analysis is reflected in the appropriate genosets.</p>

The aim of the study was to map SNP/gene associations with environmental pathogen-richness in relation to genomic variations across geographic human populations. This 2009 article found that "six risk alleles for inflammatory bowel (IBD) or celiac disease are significantly correlated with micropathogen richness. These data support the hygiene hypothesis for IBD and provide a large set of putative targets for susceptibility to helminth infections." (Abstract) Table I. identified rs3024490 among a list of 44 SNPs analyzed in relation to micro- and macro-pathogens. This SNP was not previously associated with IBD and celiac disease and was negatively associated with pathogen richness.  This 2009 study identified a haplotype among Ghanaians consisting of minor alleles at four SNPs in the IL-10 gene: rs1800871, rs1800872, rs3024490 and rs1554286. This combination of risk alleles led to lower IL-10 expression and higher TNF gene expression, resulting in a pro-inflammatory response. The authors explain that in Ghana, "pro-inflammatory alleles rescue their carriers of excess mortality in adverse environmental conditions" such as drinking from boreholes, and thus minor alleles occur more frequently in African populations, but "in an affluent environment, the same pro-inflammatory response leads to increased mortality," and minor alleles occur much less frequently (i.e. in Caucasian populations).</p>

WikipediaThe rs2285644(C) allele encodes a proline at this position, which corresponds to Di(b). The rs2285644(C;C) genotype results in the Diego phenotype Di(a-b+), found in over 99.9% of Caucasians and Blacks, and over 90% of Asians.The rs2285644(T) allele encodes a leucine at this position, which corresponds to Di(a).  As stated above, this is found primarily only those with East Asian  (Di(a+b+) is found in 10% of Asians overall) or indigenous American (North or South) ancestors. Dia antigen is more commonly found in Oriental people of Mongolian descent, being more common in the Japanese (12%) and the Chinese (5%). In South American Indians, up to 54% of the population carries the Dia antigen. Therefore, the most common phenotype in most such populations is Di(a+b+).Non-ABO Blood Groups</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3811">rs7946, a SNP in the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase PEMT gene and also known as +5465G-A, leads to a V175M (valine to methionine at amino acid position 175) substitution in the PEMT protein, and is a loss of function mutation. Caucasians with nonalcoholic fatty liver are more likely to carry the rs7946(T), with the effect being most pronounced for rs7946(T;T) genotypes. However, rs7946(T) carriers are in general not more likely to have fatty liver, based on a study of many more patients, including ones of Hispanic and African-American descent. How can this be? One explanation () suggests the following:  Caucasians have a different distribution of this SNP than do Hispanics and African Americans;  Having this SNP may be necessary, but is not sufficient, to cause fatty liver, as many individuals with the SNP have normal liver fat;  Probably this SNP does slow the export of fat from liver, but only rs7946 carrying individuals who also take in too many calories too quickly (i.e. overeat) will wind up with fatty livers.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="215">Variation at this SNP, located in the ADRB1 gene, may encode either the amino acid serine or glycine at amino acid position 49 of the corresponding protein, the beta-1 adrenergic receptor (hence why it is frequently called Ser49Gly). This protein is the target of beta blocker drugs, and so how well the drug works to help lower a patients high blood pressure depends in part on this SNP. The status of this SNP is often reported together with the status of SNP rs1801253, which encodes an amino acid variant at position 389 of the same (ADRB1) protein.One of the best known studies of the effects of these 2 separate SNPs on the average efficacy of the beta blocker metoprolol in lowering blood pressure (BP) can be summarized for patients with the corresponding genotypes as follows : rs1801252(A;A) and rs1801253(C;C) carriers: 15 point drop in BP rs1801252(A;G) and rs1801253(C;C) carriers:  9 point drop in BP rs1801252(A;A) and rs1801253(C;G) carriers:  6 point drop in BP rs1801252(A;G) and rs1801253(C;G) carriers: <1 point drop in BPrs1801252 may also influence resting heart rate; see below. - Additionally, rs1801252 may have some influence on personality, with Gly carriers showing increased odds of low or very low extraversion levels in this particular study (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.05-2.71).</p>
