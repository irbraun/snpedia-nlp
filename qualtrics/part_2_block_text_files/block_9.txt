After 1000-2000 times doing this, the B12 gets turned into a useless form, and MTRR turns the B12 back into the useful form so that the molecule of MTR can keep working.

The AANAT protein plays a unique role in vertebrate biology by controlling rhythmic production of melatonin in the pineal gland. Its activity increases 10- to 100-fold at night, leading to increased production and release of melatonin.In a 2003 report about Japanese patients with a sleep disorder known as susceptibility to delayed sleep phase syndrome, patient genotypes had a higher frequency of the rs28936679(A) allele.A later report based on Brazilian (primarily Caucasian) patients including those with delayed sleep phase syndrome found no variation at this SNP.</p>

It seems likely that primarily (G;G) homozygotes would be at increased risk for breast cancer but this has not been demonstrated. ClinVar has designated both minor alleles as pathogenic for breast cancer.This variant is considered to be the first BRCA1 mutation identified in an African-American family. It is also among the most common hereditary breast cancer mutations observed in a group of Nigerian patients.23andMe name for the T>G variant: i5010037  See also  Omim 113705.0035</p>

Researchers believe that 6% of Ashkenazi Jews carry this gene mutation, making them at a significantly higher risk for developing colorectal cancer. It is also found among Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews and Muslim and Christian Palestinian Arabs, as well as Negev Bedouin. Many patients with colorectal cancer experience no symptoms in the early stages. In fact, symptoms may not appear until the disease is in advanced stage. Routine colorectal screening is very important. Even children from 11 years of age should be screened if there is a family history of colorectal cancer.   /  APC I1307K and Colorectal Cancer - Johns Hopkins Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Website   Cancer.net: Familial Adenomatous Polyposis</p>
