The reference nucleotide at this position (on the forward strand as listed in dbSNP) is (T); the alternative alleles are (C) and (G). rs45553935(C) corresponds to a BRCA1 change known as Val1736Ala or V1736A, whereas rs45553935(G) corresponds to Val1736Gly or V1736G.This BRCA1 SNP is listed at pathogenic for breast cancer in ClinVar, although the evidence is somewhat indirect. For V1736A, there is now a publication studying the change in depth and concluding it does predispose carriers to breast cancer.,The evidence indicating V1736G is pathogenic appears to primarily be computational (i.e. predictive, such as ) and should be treated with caution. There are breast cancer patients harboring the BRCA1 V1736G mutation, but to our knowledge, to date there is no pedigree or other direct evidence confirming pathogenicity.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2220">rs1064651, also known as Asp448His or D448H, is a SNP in exon 9 of the GBA gene on chromosome 1. As the protein was originally numbered, though, this variation occurred at amino acid 409 (rather than 448), so the scientific literature still often refers to this mutation as Asp409His or D409H.Mutations in both copies of a person's GBA gene may lead to Gaucher's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. When one of the mutations is the D409H mutation, the clinical description may be Gaucher disease type 3C, involving valvular heart disease. However, the clinical presentation appears to be highly variable as well as dependent on which two mutations are present. For more information, see OMIM  606463.0006.Be aware that since this mutation is due to a G>C (tranversion) when oriented in the direction the gene is transcribed, interpretation can be problematic due to  orientation issues involving  ambiguous flips.</p>

We identified one risk haplotype (GGGG; P=0.017) and one protective haplotype (AAAA; P=0.007) for development of CAD. Further analysis suggested that the SNPs probably confer susceptibility to CAD in a dominance model (covariates-adjusted P=0.001 to 0.024; OR=2.37 to 1.54). Also found to be significant in a study of 416 Italian myocardial infarction patients.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3235">rs1799750 is a relatively common SNP at position -1,607 of the promoter of the MMP1 gene, consisting of an insertion polymorphism. In general, the insertion genotype ("2G/2G") is reported to lead to higher transcriptional activity of this gene, leading potentially to higher levels or rates of collagen breakdown.In a study of ~200 breast cancer patients, those with rs1799750(G;G) genotype, i.e. also known as the "2G/2G" genotype, had increased frequency of lymph node metastasis and thus a poorer prognosis. The odds ratio for mixed ethnicities was 3.9 (CI: 1.7-9.4, p=0.001), and when calculated only for Caucasians, 2.6 (CI: 1.0-6.9, p=0.06).Subsequently, a 2012 meta-analysis based on about 10,000 cancer cases, half of which metastasized, concluded that 2G/2G genotypes had a slightly higher overall risk of metastasis (OR = 1.44 for homozygous minor, CI: 1.05-1.98). no influence on varicose veins</p>

The (A) allele encodes the amino acid glutamine (instead of arginine), and it is associated with increased odds of having green/hazel eye color in some Caucasian populations. One copy of of rs1800407(A) is sufficient for this effect. PMID 12163334, PMID 15889046;  OMIM 203200.0012 According to tree scanning analysis, the proportion of eye colour variation explained by this nucleotide position is merely 4%. Thus, additional variation present in the OCA2 gene and perhaps some other pigment related genes must be taken into account in order to explain the high phenotypic variation in iris colour. Among rs12913832(A;A) individuals, the penetrance for green/hazel eyes was 50%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, for rs1800407(A;A), (A;G), and (G;G) genotypes, respectively.

Note that POAG is typically considered a disorder that is recessively inherited, and that the age of onset is known to be quite variable even for a given single mutation.A functional study in 2008 concluded that this mutation (the Y81N variant) should be considered a hypomorphic allele rather than a mutation, since the enzymatic activity of corresponding protein was in between that of a classic CYP1B1 mutant and that of a normal protein.More recently, the variant has been categorized as benign in ClinVar. In ExAC, it is clearly a rare variant, with an average minor allele frequency of 0.006, but showing the highest frequency in Finnish European populations (0.04).Overall, the significance of this variant is unclear. A person carrying one or more minor rs9282671 alleles may wish to bring this to the attention of relevant health-care providers, but it could well be medically unimportant.</p>

This is classified as a sleep disorder, although it does not appear to have any known negative medical consequence.The correlation between P384R and FNSS was first reported in 2009. In 2014, an independent group studying a (relatively small) group of people also saw the correlation between P384 and FNSS, while also finding another similiar variant in the BHLHE41 gene, Y362H (c.1084C>T; also known as Tyr362His). The Y362H variant does not have a dbSNP SNP designation at this time. Research published in 2018 suggests that in human short sleepers, this variant weakens the DEC2 protein's ability to suppress the MyoD1 protein, which in turn leads to more orexin production, causing short sleepers to stay awake longer.; news</p>

Although the effect observed was strong, in that treating rs2240017(C;G) heterozygotes ultimately (over 4 years) yields average airway responsiveness in the normal range (i.e. in the same range as for nonasthmatics), the authors point out that the relatively small number of heterozygous children studied indicates that a larger study is warranted to ensure reproducibility.

Each copy of the minor allele, rs16890979(T), was associated with a decrease of 0.47 mg/dl in the uric acid level (CI: 0.31-0.63, p = 1.43 x 10e-11).  See also: / 23andMe blog goutIndependently, a large study totaling 7,699 participants in the Framingham cohort and 4,148 participants in the Rotterdam cohort was conducted, with genome-wide significant SNPs then replicated in 11,000+ Caucasian and ~4,000 African-American individuals who took part in the study of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC). This study calculated an odds ratio of 0.59 per T allele (CI: 0.52-0.68, p=7.0x10e-14). A genetic score comprised of this SNP plus 2 others may stratify risk for gout.  rs16890979 was found to be associated with gout based on a study by the eMERGE network in which electronic medical records were searched to find clinical associations associated with selected SNPs.</p>

Note however that this study did not study mice heterozygous for the rs79023478(A) variant.Furthermore, a 2016 publication studying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy diagnoses across diverse populations observed that there is a very large difference in the frequency of the R4344Q variant between Caucasians and African-Americans: around 0% vs 10%, respectively. Given a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy frequency of about 1 in 500 people in general across most populations (including African-Americans), this argues that either the penetrance of the R4344Q variant is very low or even that it is benign, although perhaps it might play a (minor?) role in the development of cardiovascular disease in a more general way and/or in the presence of certain environmental or biological stressors.</p>

Caucasians with nonalcoholic fatty liver are more likely to carry the rs7946(T), with the effect being most pronounced for rs7946(T;T) genotypes. However, rs7946(T) carriers are in general not more likely to have fatty liver, based on a study of many more patients, including ones of Hispanic and African-American descent. How can this be? One explanation () suggests the following:  Caucasians have a different distribution of this SNP than do Hispanics and African Americans;  Having this SNP may be necessary, but is not sufficient, to cause fatty liver, as many individuals with the SNP have normal liver fat;  Probably this SNP does slow the export of fat from liver, but only rs7946 carrying individuals who also take in too many calories too quickly (i.e. overeat) will wind up with fatty livers.

Canavan disease is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. It is a childhood onset disease which begins in early infancy. It is characterized by disordered muscular behavior (e.g., hypotonia, hyperextension) and neurological symptoms, such as blindness, developmental and cognitive delays. The neurological findings appear to be due to demyelination and leukodystrophy. Histology indicates the presence of spongy degeneration; cytology confirms astrocytic swelling of normal neurons and abnormality of astrocyte mitochondria.  Ultimately, sufferers become extremely ill and die on average at 18 months of age.rs28940279 is a SNP in the aspartoacylase ASPA gene.   The A-C transversion results in a substitution of alanine, a hydrophobic small-chain amino acid, for a glutamate (which is both large and charged). This substitution, E285A, is at a residue predicted to be part of the catalytic domain of aspartocyclase. This missense mutation is predicted to have drastic effects on the catalytic domain because of the vast difference between the amino acids.In particular, this substitution is common in Ashkenazi Jews, with carrier frequency approximately 1 in 60 individuals.  This suggests that some degree of founder effect is responsible for its prevalence within the Ashkenazi Jewish population. In particular, one study suspects that the mutation originated in the Vilna area, in Poland or Lithuania depending on the political timeperiod of origin.  This suggests that it is a newer variant than others found in the more broad European population.</p>

The wild-type (non-deletion) allele is a bit more common than the deletion allele in most populations. Several studies have linked this SNP to alterations in folic acid (and folate) metabolism. A study of 1,215 subjects  from the Framingham Offspring Study concluded that rs70991108 influences the prevalence of circulating folic acid levels. Specifically, folic acid intake over 500ug/d led to high circulating (unmetabolized) folic acid levels in subjects homozygous for the deletion genotype. When folic acid intake was under 250ug/d, the deletion/deletion homozygotes had lower RBC folate (732.2 nmol/L) compared with the non-deletion genotype (844.4 nmol/L). A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs70991108 deletion allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~4.6x for heterozygous and homozygous rs70991108 deletion genotypes, respectively (p=0.05).

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1440">This is a CYP2C8 SNP. The CYP2C8 3 allele is mapped to both rs10509681 and rs11572080). In a 2009 article titled "Genetically based impairment in CYP2C8- and CYP2C9-dependent NSAID metabolism as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding: is a combination of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics required to improve personalized medicine?" It is claimed that individuals carrying minor alleles of this SNP (usually heterozygotes, since minor homozygotes are rare) may show increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib. In a 2008 article (reviewed in ) titled "Interaction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes modifies the risk for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related acute gastrointestinal bleeding," the study discovered that carriers of CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a GI bleeding event risk OR=1.81 (95% CI=0.95–3.46; P=0.071) and risk increased if carriers drank more than 20g alcohol/day to an OR=1.99 (95% CI=1.06–3.74; P=0.034). As CYP2C8 3 and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium, patients are likely to carry the risk allele to both 8 3 and 9 2, and when they do, The OR (95% CI) for carriers of such a genotype is increased to 1.94 (1.13–3.33), P=0.017.   A 2013 NIH review titled "PharmGKB summary: very important pharmacogene information for cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8" reiterated that "some data suggest that the combined presence of minor risk alleles CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080) and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 is a determinant of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding."

The odds ratio for rs2802292(G;G) vs (T;T) carriers was 2.75 (p = 0.00009; adjusted p = 0.00135).

According to the HapMap database the frequency of the "die early" (T) version of the variant varies substantially between populations: it's around 76% in Japanese, slightly more common (81%) in Chinese, less common (58%) in Europeans, and quite rare (17%) in West Africans.

Among rs3798220(C) carriers, the risk was reduced more than twofold by aspirin: for aspirin compared with placebo the age-adjusted HR was 0.44 (CI: 0.20-0.94). The risk was not significantly reduced among non-carriers (age-adjusted HR=0.91, CI: 0.77-1.08). This interaction between carrier status and aspirin allocation was significant (P=0.048).

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4000">rs705381, also known as -161C/T and -162A/G, is a SNP in the upstream promoter region of the PON1 gene.  (The assumption of equivalence between these names is based on the results of searching for rs705381 in the  Variant Name Mapper.) In a study of 101 mostly Caucasian patients prescribed the atypical antipsychotic risperidone, carriers of a rs705381(C) allele were less likely to gain significant weight compared to rs705381(T;T) carriers, as assessed by physiogenomic analysis of corresponding weight profiles. Two other SNPs, rs8179183 and rs6837793, were also significantly associated with weight profiles in these patients. In a study of 461 participants in the HERITAGE cohort (172 African-American, 289 Caucasian), the combination of rs705381 with "PON-126" (RS ID unknown) were found to significantly contribute to trait-anxiety scores.  The authors also cite another paper, , which found that this SNP accounts for 2.4% of the variation in PON1 expression.  Which allele correlates  with increased trait-anxiety scores and/or reduced PON1 expression is unclear.HapMap frequencies for this SNP seem dubious.  They list rs705381(T;T) as being at or near 100% for the population groups reported by SNPedia.  However, the raw data at HapMap for this SNP are largely no-call (e.g. CEU: NN=87, TT=82, CT=3).  The other diversity studies listed at  dbSNP show C as the more common allele (e.g. AFD_AFR_PANEL: CC=47.8%, CT=39.1%, TT=13.0%).  Anecdotal data submitted by participants at 23andme also show C as being more common (CC=4, CT=1, TT=2).  The diversity data have therefore been removed until these discrepancies can be resolved.

The rs6280(C) allele encodes a glycine, and the (T) allele encodes a serine (in dbSNP orientation).In a study of 88 patients being treated for schizophrenia with olanzapine, those who were rs6280(C;C) homozygotes had greater positive symptom remission (endpoint rating of minimal or none on all PANSS clinical response positive items, 39.1%), as compared with (C;T) or (T;T) genotypes (13.8%; p = 0.033). Ser9Gly has been implicated in executive function in some studies, but the results are conflicting.  Gly/Gly carriers showed significantly (p = 0.002) poorer performance than Ser/Ser carriers on executive functioning tasks in a somewhat small Caucasian sample (84 patients with first-episode psychosis and 85 controls).  Gly/Ser heterozygotes had 23% more preservative errors on the WCST compared to Ser/Ser homozygotes in a small (216) healthy Han Chinese sample (p = 0.009). Differences between homozygotes were not statistically significant.  No association between WCST scores and Ser9Gly was found in 138 schizophrenic patients.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="581">rs1799807, also known as D70G, is a SNP in the BCHE gene.  This SNP affects the structure, activity, and substrate specificity of the BuChE (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme. Cholinesterases and cholinesterase inhibitors, p. 48 The variant form, rs1799807(G), replaces aspartate with glycine at the secondary substrate/inhibitor binding site.  This single base substitution yields the "atypical" version of BChE.  This version has a lower affinity for many substrates, including many Cholinesterase Inhibitors (CIs).  A different cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) is an important component of neurotransmission by acetylcholine (ACh), terminating the action of ACh after it has been released during neurotransmission. BChE is found widely in the plasma and normally binds to CIs, protecting AChE from being inhibited by CIs and so maintaining normal neurotransmission by acetylcholine.Practical consequences of altered substrate affinity from this SNP include:  Succinylcholine, commonly used as an anesthetic, depends on BChE hydrolysis for recovery.  rs1799807(G;G) homozygotes experience a much delayed return to spontaneous breathing following its use.    "Atypical" BChE has a low affinity for CI alkaloids naturally occuring in certain plants, particularly those in the nightshade family (potato, tomato, peppers, eggplant, etc.).  rs1799807(G) carriers may be more prone to physiological consequences of AChE inhibition from eating these foods.  Many pesticides are CIs, including organophosphates and carbamates.  rs1799807(G) carriers may have atypical reactions to pesticide residues on foods and in the environment.  Many nerve agents, such as Sarin and VX gas, as well agents used to protect soldiers against them, such as pyridostigmine, are CIs.  rs1799807(G) carriers may be more susceptible to exposure to these agents.  "Atypical" BuChE, rs1799807(G), has 30% lower enzymatic activity than the wild-type enzyme.  Homoygous carriers of this polymorphism, rs1799807(G;G), display extreme anxiety after exposure to CIs.

The most common allele has a run of 5 G's in the area around this SNP, and in the literature the allele is commonly called the 5G allele. A deletion of one nucleotide leads to the "4G" allele, i.e. rs1799889(-).The 4G allele has been reported to increase risk for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease ; on the other hand, the 5G allele may increase the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and newer antidepressant drugs ,. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is to be confirmed.

However,could not be reproduced in a large (~900) -trial with outpatient with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , the significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome among all studies with this SNP becomes insignificant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. However, the association remained significant after Bonferroni-correction in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients.rs2032583 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele.

In the orientation as shown in dbSNP, the more common rs3775291(G) allele encodes a leucine while the rarer rs3775291(A) allele encodes a phenylalanine.rs3775291 has been associated with one form of age related macular degeneration (ARMD), specifically, the form known as "dry" ARMD, also known as geographic atrophy. A study of 3 case-control groups of Americans of European descent, comprising about 900 ARMD patients in total, indicated that having one rs3775291(A) allele reduces the odds of having dry ARMD about 30%, and being a rs3775291(A;A) homozygote cuts your odds by more than half. Specifically, the odds ratio of having dry ARMD with one minor allele is 0.712 (CI: 0.50-1.0), and for two minor alleles, 0.437 ( CI: 0.227-0.839).

F5, also known as coagulation factor V (proaccelerin, lavile factor), encodes an essential cofactor of the blood coagulation cascade and defects in this gene have been known to result in either an autosomal recessive hemorrhagic diathesis or an autosomal dominant form of thrombophilia.  Recently, this SNP has been found to be associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE).  VTE, which can manifest itself as either deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common cardiovascular condition with a high mortality rate .  Annually, ~2 million adults develop DVT and approximately 600,000 PE hospitalizations and 60,000 deaths occur .  In a study done by Tang et al., a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted by first analyzing the top SNP associations for total incident VTE in CHARGE (cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology) and then the second-stage studies were performed using data from three case-control studies: the Mayo Clinic VTE Study, the MARseille Thrombosis Association VTE Study, and a French case-control study on early-onset VT.  In the CHARGE GWAS, 1,618 VTE cases were included from 44,499 participants, all of which were of European origin.  From that, the top 1,047 SNPs identified as having the greatest association were analyzed in 3,231 VTE cases and 3,536 controls.The initial CHARGE GWAS revealed that the rs6427196 G minor allele had a risk ratio (RR) of 1.82 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.58 to 2.10.  The p-value of this association was 1.97 x 10-16.  The second-stage analysis gave a RR of 2.31 with a 95% CI of 2.04 to 2.62 and a p-value of 2.56 x 10-38.  At this point, all the studies were combined to give an overall RR and p-value which indicated rs6427196 as the highest associated SNP with VTE.

No rs# has yet been assigned to this location. SSS is a group of disorders that affect heart rhythm.MYH6 c.2161C>T was discovered in a GWAS published in March 2011 .  The discovery phase included 792 Icelandic cases with 37,592 Icelandic controls.  The SNPs with the strongest associations with SSS were rs2231801, rs28730774 and 14-22399934.  Since rs28730774 was the most significant SNP on the HumanOmni1-Quad chip (p = 1.6E-11; OR = 3.49; minor allele frequency = 0.01), it was studied further. In the second phase of the study, 7 chip-typed Icelandic cases (4 with the rs28730774 SNP) and 80 chip-typed Icelandic controls were subjected to whole genome sequencing.  In this analysis, the MYH6 c.2161C>T variant had the strongest association with SSS.  The mutation is located in exon 18 of the MYH6 gene and leads to an arginine to tryptophan amino acid alteration at amino acid 721.

Additionally, 184 Danish, 94 Dutch and 1498 US controls were compared to 135 US SSS cases, and no carriers of MYH6 c.2161C>T were found. The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome was reported to be around 6% for non-carriers of c.2161C>T but approximately 50% for carriers of this (c.2161C>T) variant.  alpha-MyHC is also associated with a 4.16-beat per minute decrease in heart rate (p=0.0019).The minor allele (T) results in a missense mutation in the ''MYH6'' gene, encoding the alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MyHC) protein.  This protein is a fast ATPase present mainly in atrial tissue.  The p.Arg721Trp variant resides in part of the converter domain of alpha-MyHC and is important for amplifying structural rearrangements of myosin during contraction.  This variant has been predicted to result in structural alterations .       As of May 2011, no frequency data are available.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2172">rs17026688 is a SNP located in an intron of the glutamate decarboxylase-like 1 GADL1 gene. It is linked to rs17026651, and both are 100% linked to a 1 base deletion known as 'GADL1 IVS8+48delG' (rs201973599).In a study of ~1,700 patients of Han Chinese descent with bipolar disorder, researchers discovered that almost all of the patients who responded well to lithium treatment had at least one IVS8+48delG GADL1 allele. Initially, the researchers were focused on two nearby SNPs, rs17026688 and rs17026651, that turned out to be proxies (due to being in high linkage disequilibrium) for the deletion variant. rs17026688(T) is the "response allele", meaning that at least in these Asian patients, bipolar patients who are carriers of at least one (T) allele are predicted to respond well to lithium treatment; rs17026688(C;C) patients are predicted to respond poorly.The odds ratios and probabilities for this study are so high that the authors are able to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV; NPV) for the connection between this DNA variant and being a bipolar patient who will respond well (or not) to lithium treatment. In a pooled cohort of ~400 patients, roughly divided equally between those responding well to lithium or not, the odds ratios, p values, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were around 80, 1 x 10e-50, 93%, 87%, 83% and 95%, respectively. To put it another way, while overall about half of all patients had a response allele and half didn't, only 1 in 14 patients who responded well to lithium lacked a response allele, and only 1 in 8 of those who did not respond well had a response allele. The authors naturally suggest the use of these SNPs as useful biomarkers for which patients with bipolar disorder will respond well to lithium treatment, and they also intend to (1) look for additional GADL1 gene variants acting similarly, especially in non-Asian populations given the rarity of this particular deletion variant outside of Asian population, and (2) see if these variants influence lithium treatment outcomes in other affective disorders such as major depressive disorder.</p>

It has also been linked to how well a patient responds to Viagra (sildenafil). Several studies have been unable to replicate one or more of the associations in at least some populations between this SNP and these conditions. The more notable studies include: rs5443(T) allele carriers are 2-3 fold more likely to be obese in Caucasian, Chinese, and African American populations.  rs5443(T) carriers are clearly at higher risk for hypertension, but this review indicates that whether they are also at increased risk for stroke and left ventricular hypertrophy remains controversial.  rs5443(T;T) women gain significantly more weight during pregnancy than rs5443(C;T) or rs5443(C;C) women, and had a significantly higher pre-pregnancy body mass index.   rs5443(T;T) genotypes respond to Viagra better. 91% of them have a "positive erectile response" upon taking Viagra, whereas only around 50% of rs5443(C;T) and rs5443(C;C) individuals respond equivalently to the drug. The odds ratio for the positive response was 10.0 (CI: 1.2 - 81.1, p = 0.01).   rs5443(T;T) patients receiving clozapine over a long term for the treatment of schizophrenia gain significantly more weight (16%) compared to patients carrying at least one rs5443(C) allele in a study of Chinese patients.  rs5443(T) carriers taking triptans for the treatment of migraines or cluster headaches were ~3 fold more likely to respond positively compared with rs5443(C;C) homozygotes (OR 2.96, CI:1.34 - 6.56, p=0.0074) in a study of ~200 Caucasian patients.  rs5443(C;T) genotypes are more prevalent in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients relative to healthy controls (odds ratio 1.43, CI: 1.04&#8211;1.98). rs5443(C;C) individuals do not lose weight under sibutramine therapy whereas (C;T) and (T;T) individuals do, based on a study of 131 obese Taiwanese patients. / 23andMe blog</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4313">rs2506030 is a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in gene RET. Its ancestral/non-risk allele is A and derived allele G. RET (ret proto-oncogene) is a cadherin family member and encodes a receptor tyrosine kinases. Functionally, it is involved in neural crest development. It’s located on the plus strand at 10q11.2 of the human genome spanning over 50K bp. There are 21 exons in the gene and 2 isoforms. Other than Hirschsprung disease, mutations in this gene is also associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia And Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) or congenital aganglionosis is a developmental defect characterized by the absence of neuronal ganglia in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Patients can be classified into 3 sub categories based on the length of the colon: short segment, long segment, or total colonic aganglionosis (TCA). The incidence is roughly 15/100,000 in population of European descent and twice as high for Asians. HSCR is a non-Mendelian disease. Mutations in a few genes have been identified to be associated with HSCR: RET, GDNF, NRTN, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, ZEB2, PHOX2B, KIAA1279, TCF4, and L1CAM.rs2506030 was first identified by Charkravarti’s group in a family-based GWAS study published in 2015. A total of 220 European American trios with short-segment HSCR were recruited and their DNA genotyped using Affymetrix platform, resulting in 500,000 SNPs. Association was tested using case pseudo-control and rs2506030 is statistically significantly different in the two groups (p value 2.78 10^-15). Furthermore, the statistical significance was confirmed in a replication study of 429 more HSCR trios of all segment lengths (p value 2.02 10^-4, combined p value 4.44 10-15, odds ratio = 2.0). Note that rs2506030 is independent of another common RET SNP rs2435357, which is common in HSCR patients based on previous studies. They hypothesize that rs2506030 affects a RET enhancer. Another study by the same group further studied rs2506030 in HSCR patients. This study includes a population case control comparison as well as family based association testing. Comparing the allele frequencies in cases and controls, there was a significant difference between allele frequencies in rs2506030  (p value 4.7 10^-10). Similarly, there is significant statistical evidence (p value = 5.3 10^9) of higher frequency of risk allele homozygotes in cases. OR was estimated to be 1.8. In addition, TDT was performed in 254 trios and 72 duos and the risk allele is over transmitted to probands (p = 9.5 10^-6).</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3475">rs1064395 is a single nucleotide variant (SNV) found in the neurocan gene (NCAN) that has been implicated as a predictor of both bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia. BD is characterized by a fluctuation between manic episodes and severe depression.  Schizophrenia is characterized by hallucinations, both visual and auditory, paranoia, disorganized thinking and lack of normal social skills.  NCAN is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is involved in cell adhesion and migration.  It contains 14 exons and spans 41 kb of the genome at the location 19p12. OMIM It has also been found that, in mice, this gene is expressed in a localized way in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain which are responsible for cognition and regulation of emotions. In 2011, a study by Cichon et al identified rs1064395 in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for Bipolar Disorder (BD).  This study was done by analyzing around 500,000 autosomal SNPs and 12,000 X-chromosomal SNPS in 682 patients with BD and 1300 controls. The patients studied were from Europe, the USA, and Australia.  The study then went forward to test the top 48 hits from their initial GWAS with an independent cohort of 1729 cases and 2313 controls, which narrowed down their significant hits to a list of eight.  These eight were then used in a meta analysis.  The rs1064395 was highly significant with a p-value of 3.02X10-8 and an odds ratio of 1.31, with A being the risk allele. The authors then further validated with a much larger sample size (6030 cases and 31,749 controls) and found a p-value of 2.74X10-4 and an odds ratio of 1.12 which, combined with their previous study lead to an overall p-value of 2.14X10-9 and an odds ratio of 1.17. In 2012, a study by M&#252;hleisen et al investigated this same SNP in case control studies involving schizophrenic patients. They designed a patient-control study using samples from patients with European ancestry.  The initial study included a cohort of 5061 patients and 9655 controls.  The risk A-allele was found more frequently in schizophrenic patients then in controls with a p-value of 2.28X10 -8 and an odds ratio of 1.11.  They followed up this initial experiment using a independent cohort from the Schizophrenia Psychiatric GWAS Consortium that included 5537 patients and 8043 controls. This follow up inquiry yielded a p-value of 0.0239 and an odds ratio of 1.07.  Thus, these authors concluded that, not only is rs1064395 predictive of BD, it is also predictive of schizophrenia.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2549">In this 2007 article, titled "Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls," rs9272346 has been reported to be associated with type-1 diabetes. The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 5.49 (CI 4.83-6.24), and for homozygotes (AA), the risk is 18.52 (CI 12.69-27.03). The P value is extremely significant at 5.47 × 10-134, considering the threshold for genome-wide significance. NOTE: In previous edits of this page, it has been noted that "the (A) allele of rs9272346 is common in various human populations, and one could consider the (G) allele as protective." However, the authors of  seem to disagree. (Of course, other significant genetic and/or environmental factors could be protecting the multitude of individuals with AG). In several other lines of their table, the allele identified as the risk allele is _not_ the minor allele. The authors are aware of the conventions for ODs for risk vs. protection, stating that risk allele ODs will be normally 1-2 and protective ODS are between 0.5-1 (Supplement 1, page 3). In light of this, if they wished to signify the G allele was protective, they would have given a protective allele odds-ratio in the range 0.5-1 to AG. Of course, any OD as large as 5.49 (for AG), much less 18.25 (for AA) is quite a significant risk factor compared to all other ODs on its table. Yet it cannot be a typographical error, since the rs9272346 OD of 5.49 and P values were replicated in their Supplement 1 page 43.  Their significant P values were confirmed to some degree in a 2015 study listed on this page. In this 2015 article titled "Association of 32 type 1 diabetes risk loci in Pakistani patients," among 191 Pakistani cases and controls, the P value for rs9272346 was (p = 2.83E − 09). However, no risk allele or odds ratio was mentioned. They cited the 2007 study on this page. They noted that "it has been difficult to determine individual effects of HLA genes 17."

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="453">Rs10766071 is a SNP in aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (ARNTL). Rs10766071 has been associated with shorter sleep duration as measured by polysomnography&#8212; a method for recording the activity of the brain, eyes, muscles, and heart while the subject sleeps. The A allele (major allele) is associated with higher sleep duration and the G allele (minor allele) is associated with shorter sleep duration (n=414). However, only one individual with the GG genotype was in the study. G is the ancestral allele and is also the minor variant (frequency = .0851) (dbSNP).ARNTL encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS domain transcription factor (PMID:11163178).Studies have shown that ARNTL is an important component of the transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) which regulates circadian rhythms. Homozygous ARNTL null mutant mice loose circadian rhythmicity, as measured by activity patterns, when transferred to constant darkness, demonstrating that ARNTL plays a key role in maintaining circadian rhythmicity (PMID:11163178). Rs1076671 was one of 13 significant SNPs (after Bonferroni correction) discovered by Kripke et al. (PMID:25660813) to be associated with sleep variables. Their study consisted of a cohort of patients of likely European ancestry who were recruited from a &#8220;busy academic sleep practice.&#8221; Patients consisted mostly of individuals who had been given a tentative diagnosis of sleep apnea, and had been sent for a polysomnography to confirm. All patients were 21 years or older.The authors of the paper collected DNA samples from the patients and then performed custom Illumina golden gate assay for 768 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This subset of SNPs was chosen because they were relevant to circadian rhythm regulation. Patients were surveyed about their sleep schedule and habits and polysomnographs were recorded of each patient. Thirty-eight phenotypic measures were analyzed. The authors performed linear or logistic regression analyses and then performed a Bonferroni correction for the total number of SNPs tested. The p-value for this association was 5.3x10-5 prior to Bonferroni correction. Importantly, this SNP is not genome-wide significant.  References: Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP).

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5099">rs3729547, is a SNP that was recently shown to be mildly associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  in the Han Chinese population and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Indian population.  . This SNP is located within  the coding sequence of the TNNT2 gene, which encodes a component of the troponin complex critical for proper sarcomeric contractility in cardiomyocytes, the cell type driving contraction in the heart. A number of earlier studies have shown that mutations in TNNT2 can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.    characterized by a thinning of the ventricular wall, or conversely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by a thickening of the ventricular wall. Both conditions lead to an overall weakening of the heart muscle and can lead to heart failure or sudden cardiac death.  The molecular mechanisms whereby mutations in the same gene (TNNT2) can lead to two diseases (DCM and HCM) with such contrasting phenotypes are still not well-understood. In a study by Li et al, rs3729547 (C to T) and another tagging SNP also in TNNT2, rs3729843 (G to A),  were shown to be associated with DCM in a cohort of Han Chinese individuals (X2= 6.63, P = 0.036; X2 = 9.787, P = 0.008, respectively) The risk allele for rs3729547 is T and the risk allele for rs3729843 is A. rs3729547 is a synonymous (isoleucine) variant whereas rs3729843 is a noncoding SNP. In this study, the authors investigated the association between 10 tagging SNPs (these two included) and DCM using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). However, the patients from this study were all members of the Han Chinese population, and therefore, these SNPs must be studied in the context of another ethnic group to validate strong associations between these SNPs and DCM. Additionally, this study was limited by its sample size, as only 97 DCM patients and 189 healthy unrelated controls partook in this study. In a second study published by Rani et al, the TNNT2 gene was sequenced in 162 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and in 179 healthy controls. HCM phenotype ranged from moderate to severe, but a limited number of corrective operations were performed in these HCM patients. In contrast to the Li et al paper, this study was conducted exclusively in patients from India. Fifteen associated variants were uncovered, including rs3729547 (C to T) and rs3729843 (G to A), which were found to be in high linkage disequilibrium in the HCM patients. They also identified a 5bp deletion polymorphism in this Indian population that was previously shown to be associated with HCM patients of French, Spanish, and Japanese origin.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2847">rs11208534 is a polymorphism within intron 3 of the Janus-activated kinase (JAK1) gene on human chromosome 1.  This SNP is reported by dbSNP as having A (ancestral) and G alleles, with a minor allele frequency of 19.2% (dbSNP). JAK1 is a membrane-associated protein-tyrosine kinase involved in the interferon-alpha/beta and &#8211;gamma pathways, which are important for immune responses to pathogens. Activation of JAK-family proteins occurs after binding of interferons to cell-surface receptors, and results in tyrosine phosphorylation of members of the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) protein family, inducing the expression of many other genes involved in diverse biological processes including various antiviral responses .This SNP has been associated with increased risk of developing severe symptoms upon infection with dengue virus. Symptoms of dengue infection vary widely in severity, and are classified by the WHO (listed in order of increasing severity) as undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and severe hypovolemic shock, or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DF commonly includes high fever, general flu-like symptoms, and sometimes severe bleeding. DHF is characterized by high fever, major hemorrhaging, circulatory failure, and extremely low blood platelet counts and if untreated can progress to DSS ( correlation was found between rs11208534 and the development of symptoms consistent with DHF in a 2010 study in Brazil of individuals seropositive for dengue virus . The top hit out of 728 SNPs in 56 genes predicted to be involved in a cellular response to viral infection was rs11208534, for which the authors report T (major) and C (minor) alleles of rs11208534, not A and G as on dbSNP. Cases (n = 50) were recruited from patients with DHF-like symptoms by active hospital surveillance in the city of Salvador, Brazil. Controls (n = 236) who had experienced symptoms of DF, but not DHF, were recruited from families living within 1 kilometer of index cases, and were matched in age categories under and over 15 years. The association between rs11208534 and DHF (P-value 2.9x10-4; OR 5.2 (95% CI 2.1-12.7) just failed to reach the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 2.6x10-4 by itself, but when combined with two other highly linked SNPs in the JAK1 gene region, rs310196 and rs2780831 (D&#8217; 0.856 and 1.0 to rs11208534 respectively), the association reached significance with a P-value of 2.1x10-4. This study provides evidence that polymorphisms in the JAK1 gene, including this one, may provide differential susceptibility to dengue virus infection, and likely other viruses as well. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is associated with polymorphisms in JAK1  Mechanisms of type-I- and type-II-interferon-mediated signalling</p>
