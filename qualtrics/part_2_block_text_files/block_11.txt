        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="337">This position is odd. Under the older reference genome build36, it was on the plus strand; in build37 it is on the minus strand. This makes it very prone to some ambiguous flip confusion in the literature, plus, 23andMe users have self-reported the flipped form. IN addition, instead of the usual SNP listed as having 2 alleles, all 4 alleles are reported in dbSNP, even if this is probably due to the strand changes. dbSNP currently says the normal allele is C, and T is the rare geno which causes a premature stop, early in the gene. We at SNPedia suspect that the A & G alleles are not common enough to have ever been genuinely reported, but for de-novo mutations each allele would be non-synonymous and result in a different amino acid. , a SNP located in the AMPD1 gene and also known as 'C34T', has at times been called the "most prevalent genetic disease mutation", at least in Caucasians.  Perhaps up to 10% of Caucasians and African-American carry one C34T allele (i.e. carry one rs17602729(A) allele) - and actually, most of them are unaware of any medically related issues since they don't typically have any particular symptoms that would warrant a trip to the doctor.So what's the issue? The AMPD1 gene encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase, which is one of the key enzymes used to process the energy source ATP. The C34T variation causes a premature stop in the protein, leading to a nonfunctional AMPD1 enzyme. Some individuals - but by no means all or even a majority apparently - who are AMPD1 deficient get muscle cramps and pains when they exert themselves. The most common genotype bringing this about is rs17602729(A;A), i.e. the individuals who carry two copies of the C34T allele and therefore have no functioning AMPD1 allele. It is not known why only some of C34T homozygotes experience muscle myalgia.Heterozygotes, i.e. rs17602729(A;G) individuals, do not seem to suffer any exercise or fitness related deficit. In fact, one of the best elite Caucasian distance runners is known to be a C34T heterozygote. In fact, heterozygotes for rs17602729 may even have advantages over those lacking a C34T allele. The most striking study reported that C34T heterozygotes are 8.6 fold (CI: 3.05 - 23.87) more likely to survive for more than 5 years without needing a heart transplant after a congestive heart failure related hospitalization than the wild-type homozygotes (i.e. rs17602729(G;G) homozygotes).  Similarly, C34T heterozygotes with coronary artery disease seem to fare better than wild-type homozygotes. This is one of the SNPs reported by NutraHacker SNPs|NutraHacker.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="199">rs2241766, also known as c.45T>G, represents a synonymous variant in the ADIPOQ gene on chromosome 3. Some studies report that the less common rs1501299(G) allele, is associated with decreased cancer risk compared with the more common (T) allele.A study of 733 breast cancer cases for 10 SNPs concluded that the rs2241766(G;T) genotype, in combination with certain genotypes at rs1501299, was at reduced risk (odds ratio 0.61, CI: 0.46-0.80). After categorizing individuals by adiponectin signaling status, this study found that compared with low signalers (the most frequent), intermediate signalers had a 0.64x decrease in breast cancer risk (CI: 0.49–0.83), and high signalers had a 0.15x lower breast cancer risk (CI: 0.02–1.28, p(trend) = 0.001).Adiponectin signaling status was assigned as follows (as oriented in dbSNP):rs1501299(C,C) + rs2241766(T,T) = low signaler<br>rs1501299(A,C) + rs2241766(T,T) = low signaler<br>rs1501299(C,C) + rs2241766(G,T) = low signaler<br>rs1501299(A,A) + rs2241766(T,T) = intermediate signaler<br>rs1501299(A,C) + rs2241766(G,T) = intermediate signaler<br>rs1501299(C,C) + rs2241766(G,G) = intermediate signaler<br>rs1501299(A,C) + rs2241766(G,G) = high signaler<br>rs1501299(A,A) + rs2241766(G,G) = high signaler<br>rs1501299(A,A) + rs2241766(G,T) = high signaler<br>Based on these criteria, adiponectin signaling status is now determined by genosets Gs325 and Gs326 for Promethease users.Note that  adiponectin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue (body fat), is involved in lipid metabolism.In other words, you are a low adiponectin signaler, and thus have basically average breast cancer risk, if you have one of these combinations of alleles: rs1501299  CC and also rs2241766 either GT or TT rs1501299  AC and also rs2241766 TTYou are an intermediate adiponectin signaler (Gs325), and thus possibly at 0.64x reduced risk of breast cancer compared to low signallers, if you have one of these combinations of alleles:  rs1501299 CC and also rs2241766 GG  rs1501299 AC and also rs2241766 GT  rs1501299 AA and also rs2241766 TTYou are a high adiponectin signaler (Gs326), and thus have the lowest (perhaps 0.15x) risk if you have one of these combinations of alleles:  rs1501299 AC and also rs2241766 GG  rs1501299 AA and also rs2241766 either GG or GT</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1609">(Published 2008) Researchers noted that reduced fT3/fT4 ratios may be significant, since various bodily tissues and organs differ in their level of dependence on fT3 and fT4. They analyzed 18 SNPs of DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3 and measured thyroid hormone levels in 552 people on L-T4 hormone replacement therapy, and three healthy control groups not on L-T4 therapy (totalling 2513 people). Analysis was adjusted for age and sex.   Among patients, the _minor_ allele of rs11206244 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio from 0.193 in Common homozygous to 0.175 in Minor homozygous (-0.18) p for trend = 0.004).   Among patients, the _major_ allele of rs2235544 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio (from 0.196 in Minor homozygous to 0.177 in Common homozygous (-.019), p for trend = 0.01).   The two SNPs rs2235544 and rs11206244, were in linkage disequilibrium (LD)  (r2 = 0.41), and rs2235544 was driving the association.   Polymorphisms of rs2235544 in both cases and controls achieved genome-wide significance for effect on fT3/fT4 ratio(p=3.6x10-13) in the general population, each minor allele increasing the ratio by 0.2SD.  Polymorphism did not affect TSH levels.   None of the SNPs in the other deiodinase genes DIO2 DIO3 influenced T3, T4 or TSH serum levels.   Reverse T3 (rT3) levels were not studied.  Regardless of the polymorphism of rs2235544, the fT3:fT4 ratio and fT3 levels were consistently and significantly lower in hypothyroid patients on L-T4 therapy than in healthy controls, and patients' mean TSH was also lower than in controls.  A 2012 study "The Relationship of Deiodinase 1 Genotype and Thyroid Function to Lifetime History of Major Depression in Three Independent Populations," researchers "confirmed prior findings that two variants in deiodinase 1 (DIO1), including a variant in the 3’ UTR of DIO1 (rs11206244), were associated with altered free thyroxine (FT4) levels in both White and African American subjects. We also found that rs11206244 genotype was associated with lifetime MD (Major Depression) in White female subjects, in particular those from high-risk cohorts. However, we found no association of current FT4 levels with lifetime MD in either ethnic group. We conclude that genetic variation influencing thyroid function is a risk factor for MD." (Abstract) This 2008 review discussed findings from previous research, such as: Carriers of the T allele of (rs11206244) exhibited higher rT3/T4 and lower T3/rT3 ratios in serum, suggesting a negative effect of this variant on D1 expression and/or activity.  In contrast, the G allele of (rs12095080) correlated with lower rT3/T4 and higher T3/rT3 ratios, suggesting increased D1 expression and/or activity of this variant.  the C allele of rs2235544 was associated with increased D1 function and increased FT3/T4 ratio.</p>

Although it has been studied for quite a while, as all the citations below show, there are very few if any statistically robust conclusions about it, and almost none of the studies reported below have been independently replicated. In "Association of the ADRA2A polymorphisms with the risk of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis." a meta-analysis of publications prior to September 2012 showed no overall association between rs553668 and T2D risk, but did find an association with very high (poor) P-value for Europeans under recessive gene model (GT=AA, OR=1.36, p=0.02, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.76).In "Genetic association of adrenergic receptor alpha 2A with obesity and type 2 diabetes." rs553668 was found to correlate with obesity in Swedish population, but not significantly for BMI-corrected T2D risk. ADRA2A is involved in sympathetic nervous system's inhibition of insulin secretion and lipolysis, so direct effect on T2D is usually sought, but the Swedish study suggest it could work through body mass. It also mentions that rs553668 has additionally been reported to be associated with risk of obesity in Caucasians and African Americans , hypertension in African Americans , and with platelet aggregation . "Exercise-induced muscle vasodilatation and genetic polymorphisms of alpha-adrenergic receptors, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and bradykinin receptor B2 in individuals without overt heart disease" provides some evidence of a link to vascular function in exercise.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="403">Apolipoprotein E ApoE status is technically defined by two different SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412.  This SNP, rs4420638, is situated about 14kb away in the adjacent ApoC1 gene and is co-inherited with ApoE and thus associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.rs4420638 (the proxy SNP) is not independent of rs429358. These two SNPs are correlated with each other and it's believed that most of the association with AD at rs4420638 is due to its proximity to rs429358. That said, rs4420638 is not a perfect proxy for rs429358 either -- rs4420638 correlates better for certain genotypes and for certain ethnicities. For example, if you have the genotype at rs4420638 that is more correlated with the e4 allele of APOE, you still only have a 50% chance of actually having the e4 allele. And rs4420638 is not very predictive for any genotype in African populations. The (G;G) form of this SNP indicates increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, however the probability and amount of increased risk is subject to some disagreement. The initial report concerning this SNP indicated a high likelihood that rs4420638(G;G) homozygotes were predictably ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes and thus at significantly (15 fold or higher) risk for Alzheimer's. However, one testing service has estimated pers. communication that 25% to 50% of people with the (G;G) are  not  actually ApoE4 homozygotes, and are more likely to be at ~2-3x increased risk based on being ApoE3/ApoE4 heterozygotes. If you were tested on deCODEme or 23andMe v3 platform, ignore this proxy and just check your status at rs429358 and rs7412. 23andme added rs429358 for people who tested on the v3 platform on 04/14/2011, so you should re-download your data if you haven't.This  AlzForum.org article suggests that ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes have a ~15-fold increased risk for developing the disease compared to ApoE3/ApoE3 carriers, whereas rs4420638(A;G) individuals have a ~3-fold increased risk.ApoE4 status is notable as being the variation that several well known scientists, including Nobel Prize winner User:Watson|James Watson, request not to learn when having their own genomes analyzed.Meta-analyses have also supported the association between the ApoE4 allele and somewhat increased risk for heart disease, with an odds ratio of 1.42 (CI: 1.26 - 1.61)./ 23andMe blog each rs4420638(G) lowered CRP by 21.8% also associated with higher total cholesterol, LDL choelsterol and triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterolNote: the :Category:On_chip_Affy500k|Affymetrix 500K chip is said to poorly tag (ie assay) this particular SNP. According to / a 23andMe discussion This is one of the SNPs which were re-analyzed April 2009. Customers with older data may wish to redownload.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5055">rs361525 is also known as the TNF-238 SNP, and occasionally the rs361525(A) allele is referred to as 238.2 (with the more common (G) allele being 238.1). This SNP in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene has been linked to a wide variety of conditions:  Breast cancer   A large study of over 5,000 Caucasian women found that rs361525(A) allele carriers were at somewhat elevated risk for breast cancer compared to the (G;G) genotype, with an odds ratio per allele of 1.18, CI: 1.04-1.35, p(trend)= 0.008.   However, a 2009 European study of 30,000 breast cancer cases, compared to 30,000 controls, found no association, or as they put it, "persuasive evidence against an overall association between invasive breast cancer risk and (this SNP)".   Graft versus host disease (GVHD)   A study of ~100 allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients in Brazil concludes that graft versus host disease (GVHD) is about twice as frequent if either the donor or the recipient is a carrier of the rs361525(A) allele.   Otitis or ear infections   Children who are rs361525(G;G) homozygotes may be more prone to ear infections; adjusted odds ratio 2.29, p=0.03).   Nasal polyps   The rs361525(A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk for nasal polyps in a study of 82 Turkish patients.   Psoriasis   A study of 160 Polish psoriasis patients indicated that the frequency of the rs361525(A) allele was significantly increased (16.8% vs. 3.1%, p=0.000017, odds ratio 8.79, CI: 2.606-29.678), and furthermore, the onset age was lower in rs361525(A) carriers.   Diabetes and verbal memory   rs361525(A) carriers showed a slower decline of verbal memory over a period of 48 weeks in a study of elderly patients with type-2 diabetes.   Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)   rs361525(G;G) babies may be at higher risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) based on a relatively small number (148) of Norwegian infants studied.   Exfoliation glaucoma   A study of 204 patients with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) concluded that rs361525 is unlikely to be a major risk factor for XFG in Caucasians.   Lymphoma  A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. Five SNPs in two cytokine genes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha, were associated with a 1.31x increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63; P = 0.01) and with a 1.64x increase in the subtype known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23-2.19; P = 0.0007).

The optimal therapeutic dose is in a relatively narrow window, so blood concentration monitoring is recommended. CYP3A5 3 carriers tend to build up higher levels of tacrolimus than CYP3A5 1 carriers, unless their tacrolimus intake is reduced.Carrying two non-expressing CYP3A5 3 alleles (in other words, the rs776746(G;G) genotype) is very common among Caucasians (over 85% of all), and is still relatively common (perhaps about half of all people) in many other populations other than those that are of African descent.

It is perhaps the most studied of the common ADIPOQ gene variants; most studies report that the less common rs1501299(A) allele, as oriented in dbSNP, is associated with decreased cancer risk compared with the more common (C) allele.A study of 733 breast cancer cases for 10 SNPs concluded that the rs1501299(C;C) genotype (in dbSNP orientation) was at increased risk (odds ratio 1.80, CI: 1.14 - 2.85). After categorizing individuals by adiponectin signaling status, this study found that compared with low signalers (the most frequent), intermediate signalers had a 0.64x decrease in breast cancer risk (CI: 0.49–0.83), and high signalers had a 0.15x lower breast cancer risk (CI: 0.02–1.28, p(trend) = 0.001).Adiponectin signaling status was assigned as follows (as oriented in dbSNP):rs1501299(C,C) + rs2241766(T,T) = low signaler<br>rs1501299(A,C) + rs2241766(T,T) = low signaler<br>rs1501299(C,C) + rs2241766(G,T) = low signaler<br>rs1501299(A,A) + rs2241766(T,T) = intermediate signaler<br>rs1501299(A,C) + rs2241766(G,T) = intermediate signaler<br>rs1501299(C,C) + rs2241766(G,G) = intermediate signaler<br>rs1501299(A,C) + rs2241766(G,G) = high signaler<br>rs1501299(A,A) + rs2241766(G,G) = high signaler<br>rs1501299(A,A) + rs2241766(G,T) = high signaler<br>Based on these criteria, adiponectin signaling status is now determined by genosets Gs325 and Gs326 for Promethease users.Note that  adiponectin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue (body fat), is involved in lipid metabolism as well as glucose regulation.In other words, you are a low adiponectin signaler, and thus have basically average breast cancer risk, if you have one of these combinations of alleles: rs1501299  CC and also rs2241766 either GT or TT rs1501299  AC and also rs2241766 TTYou are an intermediate adiponectin signaler (Gs325), and thus possibly at 0.64x reduced risk of breast cancer compared to low signallers, if you have one of these combinations of alleles:  rs1501299 CC and also rs2241766 GG  rs1501299 AC and also rs2241766 GT  rs1501299 AA and also rs2241766 TTYou are a high adiponectin signaler (Gs326), and thus have the lowest (perhaps 0.15x) risk if you have one of these combinations of alleles:  rs1501299 AC and also rs2241766 GG  rs1501299 AA and also rs2241766 either GG or GTThis is one of the SNPs reported by NutraHacker SNPs|NutraHacker.</p>

Further confirmed PMID 18207215, PMID 18206206. The genotype at highest risk is (A;A).Note, most studies have shown that that this SNP is highly predictive (i.e. is in near perfect (D'>0.98) linkage disequilibrium) with rs10490924, thus the status of one very closely predicts the status of the other.  However, one Caucasian AMD study reported the linkage disequilibrium measure for these two SNPs on 10q26, (i.e., rs10490924, which is upstream of HTRA1 in LOC387715/ARMS2, and rs11200638) as D'=0.8, and all four possible haplotypes of the two SNPs were detected in the samples.  Further, this same study reported that these two SNPs appear to contribute equally to the risk of AMD (both GA and CNV) and show no evidence of interaction with CFH .A 2011 meta-analysis concluded that rs11200638(A;G) and (A;A) carriers had 2.243 and 8.669 times the risk of developing AMD, respectively, when compared with those who carry the (G;G) genotype. rs10490924 and rs11200638 defined 2 significant haplotypes associated with increased risk of neovascular AMD. show that rs11200638 has no significant impact on HTRA1 promoter activity in three different cell lines, and HTRA1 mRNA expression exhibits no significant change between control and AMD retinas A study of 95 Taiwanese Chinese confirms rs11200638(A) allele risk for both wet and dry forms of AMD, with heterozygote odds ratio of 1.97 CI:0.81-4.81, homozygote OR = 8.59 CI: 3.28-22.49, p=6.7x10<sup>-3</sup> for an additive allele-dosage model. A study of Chinese AMD patients reports a 7.6x increased risk for rs11200638(A), and finds that smoking almost doubles the risk, to 15.7x increased risk. Carriers of both rs11200638 and rs800292 risk alleles pushes the odds ratio up to 23x. Overall, an "extremely high" population attributable risk (PAR) of 78% reported for these SNPs.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1613">. Published 2009. This study analyzed polymorphisms of SNPs rs12885300 (called "(ORFa)-Gly3Asp") and rs225014 (called "Thr92Ala") in relation to DIO2 gene activity in BPAD (Bipolar disorder) patients in China. Findings in abstract: "Both SNPs were significantly higher in the BPAD patients, with odds ratios of 1.489 ... and 1.616 ... respectively. Individuals with two copies of the variant 3Gly or 92Ala were at greater risk of BPAD.... Haplotypes ORFa-3Asp-92Ala and ORFa-3Gly-92Ala indicated higher susceptibility for BPAD with odds ratios of 3.759 (95% CI=2.013-7.020) and 1.292 (95% CI=1.017-1.642), respectively, while ORFa-3Asp-92Thr probably played a protective role with an odds ratio of 0.395 (95% CI=0.284-0.549)." (Abstract). A 2008 article titled "Identification of DIO2 as a new susceptibility locus for symptomatic osteoarthritis" explained that "Confirmation and replication by association in the additional osteoarthritis studies indicated a common DIO2 haplotype, exclusively containing the minor allele of rs225014 and common allele of rs12885300, with a combined recessive odds ratio of 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-2.34 with P = 2.02 x 10(-5) in female cases with advanced/symptomatic hip osteoarthritis." (Abstract). This 2011 study examined various shapes of hip joints in relation to osteoarthritis (OA) risk alleles. They "observed a significant interaction between carrier status of DIO2 rs12885300 and hip OA characteristics for mode 1 (shown in Figure 1) (P = 0.005). ... This specific aspect of hip shape correlates with OA characteristics only in carriers of the susceptibility allele." (Abstract) The -258A/G (SNP rs12885300) polymorphism of the human type 2 deiodinase gene is associated with a shift in the pattern of secretion of thyroid hormones following a TRH-induced acute rise in TSH.. After thyroidectomy, high doses of L-T4 are used to suppress TSH. Since no T3 is being produced by the thyroid, the body depends on D1 and D2 enzymes to convert T4 into the active T3. This study collected 1905 serum samples from 151 patients over 8.8 to 11.5 years and analyzed four SNPs: DIO1-rs11206244 (D1-C785T) DIO1-rs12095080 (D1-A1814G)  DIO2-rs225014 (D2-Thr92Ala) DIO2-rs12885300 (D2-ORFa-Gly3Asp). Their data "suggest that the negative feedback of FT(4) on TSH is weaker in patients homozygous for the D2-rs12885300 T allele than in wild-type and heterozygous subjects." These patients "have an altered set point of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis." However, they noted that their data depended on TSH and T4 levels alone, since T3 and rT3 were measured at only one time point during the study. A common variation in deiodinase 1 gene DIO1 is associated with the relative levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine. (Published 2008). Attempted to study rs12885300 but this SNP failed quality control due to duplicate errors and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The study found significant effects with variants of another DIO1 SNP, rs2235544.See further discussion of this DIO2 gene's other SNP : rs225014</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="862">'''rs2281845''' is a SNP located on chromosome 1q32.1, about 250 bp upstream of the first exon of the CACNA1S (voltage-dependent calcium channel, L type)gene. The linkage disequilibrium block containing rs2281845 extends 22 kb downstream and includes the TMEM9 gene (transmembrane protein 9). This SNP has been clinically  associated with tooth development. The minor allele (T) has specifically been associated with reduced mature dentition between the ages of 6 and 14 in women. In a 2011 report, a genome-wide quantitative trait association study conducted with 521,741 SNPs over 5,097 women from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) found a significant (p-value=1.31E-10) association between the rs2281845 T allele and a reduction in permanent teeth erupted (-0.105) between ages 6 and 14. To confirm this finding, an additional 3,696 individuals were also tested for this association. These subjects were drawn from three additional Danish cohorts, as well as one from the United States. The association was replicated in each of the Danish cohorts (p-values=5.43E-05, 1.09E-04, and 0.012, respectively), but the group from the United States exhibited a weak association (p-value=0.242) in the opposite direction (+0.065 teeth). This contradictory finding was attributed to small sample size and deficiencies in phenotype reporting. The original GWAS and replication datasets, when combined for a total of 8,793 subjects, showed a statistically significant (p-value=8.03E-17) negative association with number of permanent teeth (-0.103). Within the same study, three additional SNPs were identified in the initial DNBC cohort GWAS as having a significant association with number of permanent teeth between ages 6 and 14. These SNPs &#8211; rs12424086, rs4491709, rs7924176 &#8211; were each validated to statistical significance with a replication set (p-values=2.30E-12, 2.16E-14, and 5.64E-19, respectively). No loci aside from those containing these four SNPs exhibited a p-value of less than 5.0E-6. Each of these SNPs that were identified in the context of dental development may be confounded by associations with generalized maturation programs. The authors note that while the phenotype of mature teeth was measured here, the SNPs could in fact correlate better with measures of puberty such as &#8220;skeletal maturation, Tanner score and growth spurt,&#8221; with number of mature teeth simply as a manifestation of these other phenotypes. Mechanistically, rs2281845&#8217;s effect on tooth development may be linked to expression of TMEM9. In a study linking SNPs to gene expression in monocytes, several variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs2281845 were found to be significantly associated with TMEM9 expression. The SNP with highest linkage to rs2281845, rs6667912 (r2=0.42) showed a significant association (p-value=6x10E-29). Little is known regarding the function of TMEM9. It is a well-conserved, 26kDa transmembrane protein with expression throughout a wide variety of human tissues and cells. An &#8216;&#8216;in vitro&#8217;&#8217; study showed localization to the ER, late endosomes, and lysosomes along with  LAMP1 coexpression, but its function within the cell is not yet well-characterized.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5111">This SNP, a variant in the TP53 gene, is 1 of 25 SNPs reported to represent independently minor, but cumulatively significant, increased risk for breast cancer. For details of all 25 SNPs in this group, along with the two methods used to calculate overall risk estimates for breast cancer, refer to the SNPedia breast cancer entry.For this particular SNP, as oriented in dbSNP and to the gene, the less common G allele encodes an arginine at position 72 of the protein (where there's normally a proline), and the SNP is commonly called the Arg72 variant, although P72R and Arg72Pro are also common in the literature. Minor allele homozygotes, i.e. rs1042522(C;C) genotypes, live on average 3 years longer than major allele (G;G) homozygotes, based on a study of 9,200+ Danish individuals. The increased longevity is speculated to be related to the increased apoptosis seen for this gain of function SNP, presumably due to "increased robustness" during the period of treatment after the diagnosis of life-threatening diseases such as cancer of certain types.A study of 148 individuals with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) concluded rs1042522(G;G) genotypes were more likely to be resistant to first-line chemotherapy, especially the irinotecan plus cisplatin regimen, than those with (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes (60% vs 27%, p = .014). In multivariate analysis, the (G;G) genotype was strongly predictive for shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio HR = 1.952, p = .01).A study of 57 patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy found that rs1042522(G;G) and rs1042522(C;G) genotypes were significantly correlated with a lower response rate (and worse progression) to the combination chemotherapy when compared to rs1042522(C;C) homozygotes (35.7 vs. 66.7%, p-value 0.019).rs1042522 is not associated with SLE in a study of Caucasians, African-Americans, and Asian children and adults.Implicated in type-2 diabetes based on a study of 1,161 Finnish patients.  rs2279744, rs1042522, rs17878362 and rs1625895 associated with high grade endometrial cancer/ 23andMe blog African Americans with rs1042522(G;G) in the p53 gene were 2.15 times more likely to die of colorectal cancer than those with one or no copies of a G at this SNP.  In Caucasians there was no association between survival and rs1042522./ 23andMe blog rs1042522(C) might have had an easier time conceiving in colder temperatures The P72 allele was found to be significantly enriched over the R72 allele among in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients. The P72 allele serves as a risk factor for implantation failure. LIF levels are significantly lower in cells with the P72 allele than in cells with the R72 allele, which may contribute to the decreased implantation and fertility associated with the P72 allele. Patients with variant TP53 genotypes either for the Arg72Pro or the PIN3 polymorphism were at increased risk of telangiectasia, a late skin side effect of radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery. Odds ratios were 1.66 for 72Pro carriers and 1.95 for PIN3 A2 allele carriers. Carrying both variant alleles led to a doubling of risk.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4811">The rs4880(T) allele, part of the codon for amino acid valine at codon 16 of the antioxidant protein from the mitochrondrial superoxide dismutase 2 SOD2 gene, is the most common in most populations studied. The rs4880(C) allele gives rise to an alanine at this position is it also known as Val16Ala manganese superoxide dismutase, or A16V. There appears to be some conflict in the literature over the effect of this SNP. Having a valine at codon 16 is said to reduce enzyme activity , and thus lead to increased oxidative stress, yet in at least one study of the actual enzyme levels measured in people, SOD2 activity was 33% higher in (C;T) or (T;T) individuals compared to (C;C) individuals . Regardless of how this resolves, several phenotypic associations have been reported for this SNP, including:  A 10 fold higher risk for heart disease in hereditary hemochromatosis patients with rs4880(T;T) genotypes compared to similar patients with rs4880(C;T) or rs4880(C;C) genotypes.   An increased risk of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) was found in individuals with rs4880(C;C) (OR = 3.07, CI: 1.55-6.05) genotypes. Odds ratios for developing mesothelioma were even higher for patients lacking obvious exposure to asbestos fibers.   Among prostate cancer patients with a rs4880(T;T) genotype, but not the (C;C) genotype, higher iron intake level was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in risk for aggressive forms of the cancer (OR=2.3, CI: 1.0-4.9).  rs4880(C;T) prostate cancer patients being treated by radiation therapy are more likely (8% compared to 0%, p=0.02) to exhibit a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding after irradiation than (C;C) or (T;T) patients, based on a study of 135 patients. The odds for this are worse if the patient also has the rs861539(C;T) genotype (14% vs 1%, p=0.002).  A study of non-Hispanic Caucasians with various types of brain tumors concluded that there was an increased risk of acoustic neuroma (odds ratio 2.0, CI: 1.1-2.7) associated with the alanine-encoding rs4880(C) allele.  rs4880(C) carriers with breast cancer and being treated with cyclophosphamide had worse survival rates (i.e. didn't benefit as much), based on a 2009 study of 248 US and 340 Norwegian patients.    A 2010 US study of ~450 women receiving cyclophosphamide + adjuvant therapy concluded that rs4880(C) carriers suffered slightly less side effects (HR 0.5) but had slightly worse disease-free survival rates (DFS 1.6); no associations were observed among 874 women who were followed without adjuvant therapy    A 2014 Danish meta-analysis plus study of ~300 patients receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy found no association with rs4880(C) genotype    A 2015 study with a relatively small number (~500) of Chinese gastric cancer patients found rs4880(C) carriers who received postoperative platinum and fluorouracil based chemotherapy were somewhat worse off than non-carriers   See also  OMIM 147460.0001  Note: rs1799725 was combined into rs4880 by dbSNPThe C allele of rs4880 appears to be slightly associated with Alzheimer's disease.  rs2758346 rs4880 and rs2855116 association with Alzheimer's disease</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1888">rs1801274 is a SNP in the Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIa, receptor (CD32) FCGR2A gene. rs1801274(C) encodes the arginine (R) allele, with the (T) allele encoding the variant histidine (H). The (H) isoform is considered high-binding to IgG2 and IgG3, while the (R) isoform is considered low-binding. This SNP is known in the literature by many names, including A519C and H131R. What's the importance of this? FcgR isoforms expressed on immune system cells have been linked to the pathogenic consequences triggered by autoantibodies or immune complexes in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as to the efficacy of some immunotherapeutic treatments such as rituximab.Many studies have been published about this FCGR2A SNP, roughly divided by either disorder or treatment as follows:  HIV to AIDS, including susceptibility and progression   In a study of HIV-infected men, those with a FCGR2a CC genotype progressed to a CD4+ cell count of <200/mm3 at a faster rate than individuals with either of the other genotypes (relative hazard = 1.6; p = 0.0001). However, the authors noted that the progression to AIDS was less impacted by this SNP, largely because TT homozygotes had an increased risk of pneumonia as an AIDS-defining illness.   Lymphoma   A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. The AG and AA genotypes of rs1801274 were associated with higher risk of follicular and small lymphocytic lymphomas: 1.26x (95% CI, 1.01-1.56) and 1.41x (95% CI, 1.10-1.81), respectively (P(trend) = 0.006). Hemophilia A  In a case-control study of 85 individuals a more than 3-fold increased risk of inhibitor development was found compared to patients with the RR genotype  Malaria   Based on a study of more than 1,800 individuals in India, rs1801274(T;T) homozgyotes were significantly associated with protection from disease manifestation, with stronger association observed in the malaria non-endemic region.   Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)   A study of 90 Japanese patients with SLE concluded that individuals with rs1801274(C) alleles were at higher risk for the disease. Classifying the reports by immunotherapeutic treatment studied yields the following:  Studies involving cetuximab:   In a study of 39 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab, the rs1801274(T) (ie H) allele was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.055), by perhaps 1-2 months.   Studies involving infliximab:   A study of 91 patients with rheumatoid arthritis found that at week 30 of treatment with infliximab, rs1801274(C;C) homozygotes had a better ACR20 response (RR: 60% and HH-RH: 33.3%; p= 0.035).   Studies involving rituximab:   In a study of 58 Croatian patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rs1801274 did not influence response, event-free or overall survival.   Studies involving 3F8, an anti-GD2 antibody:   In a study of 136 patients with high risk neuroblastoma treated with the anti-GD2 antibody 3F8 plus GM-CSF immunotherapy, the rs1801274(C;C)(ie R/R) genotype was correlated with progression-free survival for the entire cohort (p = .049) and for the subset of patients with no history of prior relapse (p = .023).

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3026">rs1048661, also known as R141L, a SNP causing an amino acid change in the lysyl oxidase 1 LOXL1 gene, has been linked to exfoliation glaucoma. This form of glaucoma causes up to 10% of the cases of blindness in many countries, including the US. Science DOI: 10.1126/science.1146554 From the abstract of this study: "Approximately 25% of the general population is homozygous for the highest risk haplotype and their risk of suffering XFG (exfoliation glaucoma) is over 100 times that of those only carrying low-risk haplotypes."The risk allele for this SNP is rs1048661(G), and it confers a estimated relative risk (by itself) of 3.04. The odds ratio is 2.46 (CI 1.91-3.16). Note that the (G) allele is actually quite common in most European populations.However, a meta-analysis published in 2010 concluded that it's likely that SNPs rs1048661 and rs2165241 are not directly implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma; only the nearby rs3825942 seemed to be the disease-associated SNP.In the original publications, the haplotypes identified as being of highest risk consisted of the combination of two SNPs together, rs1048661(G) and rs3825942(C), oriented with respect to the dbSNP entry. In the two populations studied combined (from Iceland and Sweden), the (G;C) haplotype has an odds ratio of 27.05, and the (T;C) haplotype has an OR of 8.90, relative to the (G;T) haplotype. The (T;T) haplotype is presumed to be at even lower risk than the (G;T) haplotype, but due at least in part to the high frequency of the rs1048661(G) allele, no individuals in this study carried it. In the populations studied, ~25% of all individuals in the population carry two copies of the (G;C), highest risk haplotype.If the risk of carrying two such haplotypes is multiplicative (which isn't known actually), the authors estimate that individuals carrying two copies of the (G;C) high risk haplotype would have 700 times the risk of developing this type of glaucoma compared to individuals carrying two copies of the (G;T) haplotype. Overall, (G;C) individuals are at ~2.5 fold higher risk than the average person in the populations studied.With so many people at high risk, shouldn't the number of cases be much higher? Not necessarily, since glaucoma risk only becomes high in older individuals. To put it another way: plenty of folks don't live long enough to find out if they would have gotten glaucoma. The estimate for glaucoma incidence worldwide is 10-20% only for individuals over 60 years of age; in Iceland, where glaucoma incidence is high, 40% of individuals 80 or older show signs of exfoliation ''syndrome'', which has been seen to convert to exfolation ''glaucoma'' at a rate of 60% - over a 15 year period. PMID 12928689, PMID 10463402, PMID 17224761Discussed in this / blog post Confirmed as risk for pseudoexfoliation (PEX) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG) in populations of German and Italian descent. rs1048661 (G), rs3825942 (G), and rs2165241 (T) are highly associated with XFS and XFG in American and European populations. The GGT haplotype constitutes a major risk haplotype for exfoliation.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2004">rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the "Fat Gene" . The original paper describing it is here .2015 research suggests rs1421085 may be the causal snp. The researchers identified 10 different FTO SNPs in the first intron of the gene that associated with both BMI and type-2 diabetes. Because they all correlated with each other, they chose to examine one of the SNPs (rs9939609) in detail.rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects. Furthermore, the minor allele frequency was much lower in Chinese populations compared to populations of European descent.  Note: The three FTO SNPs, rs1421085, rs17817449, and rs9939609, are in strong linkage disequilibrium (pairwise r<sup>2</sup>>0.97), and there are two primary haplotypes, C-G-A (42.0 %) and T-T-T (55.5 %). 1,638 type 2 diabetes patients and 1,858 controls rs9939609 in FTO (OR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.25, p = 0.006) A study of 3,000+ UK children indicated that (A;A) genotypes were less satieted (i.e. had greater appetite) than other genotypes, indicating this risk allele for obesity is likely to influence appetite. This SNP is also associated with (severe) obesity in a study of 927 Japanese patients. This SNP may contribute to variation in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels independently of obesity; average CRP levels may be 12-14% higher per rs9939609(A) allele. This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.  A longitudinal study of Finnish children concluded that the effect of rs9939609 on BMI only becomes evident after age 7, and that the FTO gene is not directly associated with energy intake or physical activity. Independent of fatness, the A-allele of the FTO SNP appears to increase mortality of a magnitude similar to smoking, but without a particular underlying disease pattern barring an increase in the risk of diseases of the nervous system. Each copy of the risk-allele A at rs9939609 was significantly associated with 0.45 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.74; P = 0.004) and 0.97 cm increase in waist circumference (95% CI: 0.21-0.65; P = 0.0002). Similar results were observed for rs8050136. may confer a modest susceptibility to obesity in an ethnicity-specific manner, but may be '''unlikely to contribute to a clinically significant diabetes risk'''. A small study (less than 700 women, divided into 4+ groups) concluded that over 3 & 6 months women in a weight-loss program who were informed they carried at least one rs9939609 risk allele lost slightly more weight than non-carriers.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2419">rs5848(T;T) found a 3.2-fold increased risk vs C-allele carriers (95% CI: 1.50-6.73, p=0.003) for ubiquitin- and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive frontotemporal dementia (FTLD-U also knows as FTLD-TDP43), a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 10% of early-onset dementia patients. Detailed haplotype analysis was conducted, indicating rs5848 as most likely causal variant. FTLD-TDP43 is divided into four subtypes, some sources suggest association with type 3 only . Association between rs5848(T;T) and frontotemporal dementia is now generally assumed in literature, despite some studies failing to reproduce it.First meta-analysis of rs5848 association with Alzheimer's disease combining previous five studies for a total of 2502 Alzheimer's disease cases and 2162 controls found association in homozygous model (TT vs. CC: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11-1.66; P=0.003) as well as recessive model. This association existed also in the Caucasian-only subset of 2227 cases and 1902 controls. Although the ''p''-value is above usually applied guidelines, the researchers concluded the data indicates association exists .  According to "First symptoms--frontotemporal dementia versus Alzheimer's disease"  as well as other sources frontotemporal dementia is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease so it is possible some studies have misdiagnosed cases. FTLD is characterized by behavioral and/or language dysfunction, but usually without the amnesic syndrome involved in Alzheimer's disease at early stage.In contrast "Reduced serum progranulin level might be associated with Parkinson's disease risk"  found that only Parkinson's disease was associated with reduces progranulin levels, but found no association between progranulin levels, rs5848 or Alzheimer's disease. "Association between GRN rs5848 polymorphism and Parkinson's disease in Taiwanese population" found association between rs5848 and Parkinson's disease, but only for female Taiwanese (OR&#8202;=&#8202;1.43, 95% CI: 1.11-1.87, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.007 for single T allele among females). Most studies have found association with neurodegenerative disorders only for recessive or homozygous model, but this is one study where odds ratio follows number of alleles (OR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.24-3.78, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.006 for two alleles among females).A functional effect is suggested in many studies such as "GRN variant rs5848 reduces plasma and brain levels of granulin in Alzheimer's disease patients"  and "Rs5848 variant influences GRN mRNA levels in brain and peripheral mononuclear cells in patients with Alzheimer's disease" . In addition "rs5848 polymorphism and serum progranulin level"  showed that progranulin level is affected by number of (T) alleles equally both in 100 patients with different forms of dementia and 36 controls: TT (164 ng/mL, 95% C.I. 138-189), CT (191 ng/mL, 95% C.I. 177-206) and CC (222 ng/mL, 95% C.I. 205-238) serum progranulin with p < 0.005. Progranulin is a growth-factor involved in regulating tumorigenesis, wound repair, development, and inflammation among other things. Rs5848 is located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) RNA tail of GRN in a binding-site for miR-659 which inhibits GRN translation. University of California, San Francisco is currently conducting clinical trial " Finding Study of Nimodipine for the Treatment of Progranulin Insufficiency From GRN Gene Mutations". Common variation in the miR-659 binding-site of GRN is a major risk factor for TDP43-positive frontotemporal dementia.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4259">rs6445975 is located on chromosome 3p14.3 and corresponds to intron 4 in the PXK gene (Phox homology domain containing serine/threonine kinase) and is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PXK is expressed in a variety of tissues including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This SNP has also been implicated as being an important modulator of cancer cell growth . For the rs6445975 SNP, the ancestral allele is a T and the disease associated risk allele is a G.rs6445975 was first found to be associated with SLE in 2008 in women of European ancestry. The study included 720 women with SLE and 2,337 controls and showed strong evidence for association (P=7.1x10&#8211;9; OR=1.25) . Additionally, a study in 2010 found that many SLE SNPs including rs6445975 showed that an increase in genetic susceptibility to SLE was associated with early disease onset. . Other studies have shown no association of rs6445975 with SLE. A study of patients mainly of Mexican ancestry included 804 patients with SLE and 667 healthy controls and found no association (Odds ratio=1.077; 95% CI=0.8&#8211;1.45; P=0.622). Another study of 910 SLE patients and 1440 healthy controls from Chinese living in Hong Kong and 278 SLE patients and 383 controls from Thailand, also found no association of rs6445975 to SLE (P=0.36, OR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.93&#8211;1.21). . A study from 2009 investigated if rs6445975 was associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) because SLE and RA share a complex etiology. They found no association of several SLE SNPs with RA, including rs6445975 (OD=1.11; 95% CI=1.0&#8211;1.2). A study of SLE in the Chinese mainland population used 288 cases and 357 controls and showed that rs6445975 is not associated with SLE (P=0.969; OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.75&#8211;1.32). . Another study examined the association of rs6445975with SLE in 527 Korean patients with SLE and 517 healthy Korean control subjects. They found no association of the rs6445975 risk allele with SLE (OR= 1.06; P=0.57). A study investigated the link between SLE and a decreased breast cancer risk in a cohort of 3,659 breast cancer cases and 4,897controls of primarily European descent. They found a slight positive association with breast cancer for the G risk allele of rs6445975 (OR=1.0911; P=0.0097) but concluded an overall weak association of breast cancer with SLE. A recent study performed a meta-analysis of 13 separate studies and identi&#64257;ed an association between SLE and the G allele of rs6445975 in the overall population (OR=1.151, 95 % CI=1.086&#8211;1.291, P=1.8E-06). There was a signi&#64257;cant association between rs6445975 and SLE in Europeans (OR=1.198, 95 % CI=1.118&#8211;1.285, P=3.4E-07), but not in Asians as expected from other studies.  Currently there is no cure for SLE, but symptoms can be managed by immunosuppressant drug treatments such as cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Generally, SLE is more common in women than in men and SLE is associated with disease risk alleles of SNPs in the following genes: ITGAM, KIAA1542, PXK, FCGR2A, PTPN22 and STAT4. Additionally, SNPs in the HLA-DQA1 and IRF5 genes have been shown to have a protective phenotype in women of European ancestry but not Asian ancestry. Most of the GWA studies performed for SLE that have been duplicated, found their results to be reproducible after accounting for differences in populations such as Europeans and Asians. rs6445975 particularly, has been shown to affect Europeans but not Asians or Mexicans. Some other studies such as those performed on Mexican or African American populations have yet to be repeated and so reliable data is not currently available.</p>

In the literature this SNP is also known as A118G, N40D, or Asn40Asp.Carriers of at least one rs1799971(G) allele appear to have stronger cravings for alcohol than carriers of two rs1799971(A) alleles, and are thus hypothesized to be more at higher risk for alcoholism. However, subsequent research results are mixed, and there are other studies both agreeing or disagreeing with this finding PMID 15525999, PMID 9399694, PMID 12960749Among 200+ alcoholics treated with naltrexone, rs1799971(G) carriers receiving the drug (even without behavioral intervention) had an increased percentage of days abstinent (p = .07) and a decreased percentage of heavy drinking days (p = .04) if treated with naltrexone vs. placebo, whereas rs1799971(A;A) homozygotes showed no medication differences.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4995">This 2003 article titled "Amino acid substitutions in the thyroglobulin gene are associated with susceptibility to human and murine autoimmune thyroid disease" performed case control association studies for 14 TG SNPs in 285 Caucasian AITD (autoimmune thyroid disease) patients and 150 Caucasian controls. They found that within the TG gene, "exon 10-12 SNP cluster and an exon 33 SNP were significantly associated with AITD."  Four polymorphisms, considered separately, had ODs over 1.3, but p values were not strong, between 0.003 and 0.12. (Supplementary tables 10,11,12) However, they discovered more significant ODs and p values when combining one or more exon 10-12 SNP alleles with the CC homozygous exon 33 polymorphism:     with or without E10SNP24 T/G = rs180223 = T allele,    with or without E10SNP158 T/C = rs2069550 = T allele,    with or without E12SNP A/G = rs853326 = A allele,     always with E33SNP = rs2076740 = CC polymorphism ODs for risk of AITD were given with the above risk alleles in combination (Table 2):   T,T,A,CC = 2.49 (p=0.0004);   T,--,--,CC = 2.42 (p=0.0005);   --,T,--,CC = 2.52 (p=0.0003);   --,--,A,CC = 2.43 (p=0.0004) The ODs for risk of HT (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and GD (Graves' disease) were similar, all above 2.38 with p values equally or more significant. (Tables 3,4) Adding significance for the exon 33 SNP in particular, they discovered "an interaction between HLA-DR3 and the exon 33 SNP" resulting in an odds ratio of 6.1 for GD. NOTE: The large odds ratio may be due to the small sample size of this study. In addition, this study focused on a Caucasian sample. Nevertheless, other studies focused on regional samples have shown similar trends. A 2015 research study titled "Correlation between thyroglobulin gene polymorphisms and autoimmune thyroid disease" focused on the Han Chinese population. A total of 270 patients with AITD and 135 healthy controls were enrolled. They found "The Tg SNP frequency distribution was significantly different between Han populations of the Northern regions of Henan province and the Xi'an regions of Shaanxi province" (Abstract).  Separate ODs were found for the following TG gene SNPs:   E10SNP24 T/G rs180223 = TT 1.35, TG 11.50, GG 0.14, (TG OD was 95%CI = 4.89-27.06, p=<0.01)  E10SNP158 T/C rs2069550 = TT 1.07, TC 0.96, CC 1.03  E12SNP A/G rs853326 = AA 0.51, AG 0.23, GG 4.22 (GG OD was 95%CI = 2.65-6.73, p=<0.01)  E33SNP C/T rs2076740 = CC 1.11, CT 0.93, TT 0.98. More significant combined ODs were received when these SNPs were were combined:  GTAC = 0.22 Hypothyroidism (HY), 0.22 Graves(GD), 0.24 Hashimoto's (HT)   GCGC = 0.57 HT  GTGC = 3.57 GD, 3.50 HT  TTGC = 4.00 HY  TCGC = 5.23 HY, 3.00 GD, 4.45 HT A 2016 study titled "Association of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) and Thyroglobulin (TG) Genetic Variants with Autoimmune Hypothyroidism" sampled 84 hypothyroidism patients and 62 controls from Gujarat, India. Researchers found that polymorphisms of the TG gene's exon 33 SNP rs2076740 significantly increased the odds of autoimmune hypothyroidism: Odds ratios were   for TT, 1.0 (Genotypes were similar between patients and controls)  for TC, 7.519 (95%CI 2.329 to 24.27, p=0.0003) compared to AA (7.729 after adjustment for age and gender).  for CC, 20.54 (95%CI 5.065 to 83.30, p=0.0001) compared to AA (15.151 after adjustment for age and gender).Researchers theorized that the TG polymorphism may "change its antigenicity making it more immunogenic" (Conclusion). They also found significant differences in patients vs. controls when analyzing the CTLA4 SNP Exon1 (+49A/G) rs231775. NOTE: The large odds ratio may be attributed to the small number of patients and controls and/or the regional sample.</p>

When stratifying by genotype, rs4143094-TG has OR=1.2, 95% CI=1.13-1.26; rs4143094-TT has an OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.22-1.59; and the minor/null genotype rs4143094-GG has an OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.98-1.07.  Several other SNPs in the 10p14 region were correlated to the same phenotype, (rs485411, risk allele C, ORinteraction=1.18; Pinteraction=1.72E-08; rs1269486, risk allele A, ORinteraction=1.18, Pinteraction=7.53E-08) though rs4143094 was highlighted due to having the most significant P-value.Colorectal cancer is the third most leading cause of cancer death in men and women , and consumption of processed meat has been linked to increased risk of its development , . rs4143094 is upstream of ''GATA3'', a gene associated with Th2 cell differentiation , which is upregulated in ulcerative colitis , a risk factor for colorectal cancer . Though the mechanism by which ''GATA3'' suppression may lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer is unknown, its suppression has been previously linked to breast, colorectal, and lung cancers . DOJ  Association between risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat.rs4143094 on chromosome 10p14 is about 7.2kb upstream of GATA3 gene. GATA3 belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors. Its functional role includes regulation of luminal epithelial cell differentiation, development of T cell, and differentiation of T helper (Th) cell. Genes in the GATA family are involved in several types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and of particular interest to this entry, colorectal cancer    . According to dbSNP, rs4143094 has two alleles, G (major allele) and T (minor allele). The minor allele has a frequency of 0.2337 across all populations. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), using data from Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), discovered a strong correlation between rs4143094 and risk of colorectal cancer when ingesting red and processed meat . In the study, approximately 2.7M SNPs were tested across 9,287 case and 9,117 control subjects, all with European ancestry. The result shows that rs4143094 is associated with risk of colorectal cancer (P = 8.73e-9), with T being the risk allele. Specifically, individuals with TG and TT genotypes are increased for occurrence of colorectal cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 and 1.39, respectively. rs4143094 resides in a 9.5 kb linkage-disequilibrium (LD) block (r2 > 0.8) containing 19 highly correlated SNPs. The third most significant among these SNPs, rs1269486, is located 1420 bases upstream of GATA3 and is in a region of open chromatin (DNA hypersensitivity). Experimental evidence suggests binding activity of Pol2 and transcription factors c-Fos, JunD, and c-Jun in this region . Many other SNPs in the LD block reside in GATA3-antisense RNA1 (GATA3-AS1).  GATA3-AS1 may regulate GATA3 transcript activity, although further experimental evidence is required. Apart from the SNP, this study also observed that red and processed meat consumption increases risk for colorectal cancer with OR of 1.15 and 1.11, respectively. For this secondary result, the author proposed the following pathway: processed meat triggers pro-tumorigenic inflammatory or immunological response, whose recovery depends upon the expression of GATA3 gene. Further experimental evidence is required to confirm this hypothesis.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4816">rs10937823 is a SNP associated with the gene SORCS2, variants of which may play a role in bipolar disorder. The allele most frequently occurring is C, and the variant is T. In the HapMap-CEU population, CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 0.894, 0.097, and 0.009, respectively. However, in the HapMap-CHB population, CT was the most frequently expressed genotype; CC, CT, and TT genotype frequencies were 0.366, 0.439, and 0.195, respectively. In some sample populations, the TT genotype did not exist (TSI, MKK, LWK, ASW).   dbSNPThe SORCS2 (sortillin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 2) gene on chromosome 4p16.1 is found to be highly expressed in the mature human brain and kidney. High levels of expression are also seen in the brain during mouse development.   GeneCards This gene family is responsible for trafficking lysosomal enzymes that are modified within the Golgi to their packaging vacuole.   Sortillins have been found to facilitate neurotrophin binding to its receptor, which is necessary for mediating neuronal apoptosis, growth and survival. Given these roles, it has been proposed that alterations to the SORCS2 gene can lead to neuronal dysfunction. In 2008, a genome-wide association study indicated the SORCS2 gene in bipolar disorder. The study conducted by Baum et al. analyzed 461 affected individuals and 563 matched controls (from the National Institutes of Mental Health Genetics Initiative, all of European ancestry), and a replication sample of 772 affected individuals and 876 matched controls (affected individuals recruited from German hospital admissions, and controls recruited from a German census). The C allele of rs10937823 was found at a frequency of 0.949 in cases and 0.912 in controls in NIMH cohort (p=0.001); 0.954 in cases and 0.931 in controls in the German cohort (p=0.004). The resulting combined odds ratio was 1.67 between the German and NIMH cohorts.  Table 3 Furthermore, with multi-locus analysis, the authors found that the highest risk of bipolar disorder was associated with presence of both rs10937823 and rs1170191, a SNP in diacylglycerol kinase eta (DGKH  Rs1170191), suggesting that these SNPs have a combinatorial effect in conferring risk (p=1.2x10-8). A Finnish bipolar family study in 2009 replicated the association between rs10937823 and bipolar disorder. The researchers genotyped the 26 SNPs most strongly associated SNPs as found by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, and the aforementioned study by Baum et al. in 723 individuals from 180 families. The study classified individuals as falling into diagnostic classes of bipolar type I disorder (cases = 214; controls = 509) or a broad mood spectrum disorder encompassing all types of bipolar disorder (cases = 298; controls = 495). In an opposite finding to that of Baum et al., the minor allele (T) frequency in the unaffected individuals was 0.999; in cases, the frequency was 0.112. The lower frequency of the T allele of rs10937823 in cases versus controls was statistically significant (p=0.004187 using broad mood spectrum disorder; p=0.004703 using broad mood spectrum disorder). In 2011, In a Japanese cohort of 736 individuals, rs10937823 was again found to be significantly associated with bipolar disorder by Takata et al. (363 cases, 370 controls; p=0.0175). However, the results showed that the risk allele (more commonly associated allele in cases) was T, not C. The minor allele frequency in the bipolar disorder sample was 0.275, versus 0.253 in the control sample. An odds ratio for this SNP was not reported. In 2011, Cristoforou et al. identified an association between rs10937823 and bipolar disorder in a Scottish population (506 cases, 607 controls; p=0.031; OR not reported). Like the Japanese study by Takata et al., the minor allele (T) was found to be associated with bipolar disease.   Similar observations of this &#8220;flip-flop&#8221; phenomenon where opposite alleles appear to confer risk have been reported in other genes, such as COMT gene and schizophrenia, and GSTO1 gene and age of onset in Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease. The authors suggest that such different results could be due to allelic heterogeneity, the effects of multiple loci, or varying linkage disequilibrium amongst the subjects, if the findings across the studies and populations are indeed correct.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2516">rs1799945, also known as H63D or His63Asp, represents a SNP that accounts for a mild form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload condition in which mutations of certain genes involved in iron metabolism disrupt the body&#8217;s ability to regulate uptake of iron, causing increased intestinal iron absorption. The most common form is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which are inherited recessively. The gene for HH is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 . In 1996, HFE, a gene for HH, was found to have two missense mutations . A mutation at amino acid 282 (C282Y) was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH. This is a point mutation from guanine to adenine, resulting in a missense mutation from cysteine to tyrosine. Such mutations are commonly found in people with European ancestry, and is more rare in Asian and African populations. Among individuals of northern European descent, hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited identified genetic disorder. However, penetrance differs between different populations.==HFE Gene==The HFE gene encodes the human hemochromatosis protein, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 at 6p21.3. The protein regulates iron absorption by regulating the interaction of the transferrin receptor with transferrin. The HFE protein interacts with TFRC, the transferrin receptor protein 1, so its primary mode of action is through regulation of the iron storage hormone hepcidin.====Mutations in the HFE Gene====The three most common HH-causing mutations in the HFE gene (chromosome 6p21.3) are C282Y (A at rs1800562 instead of G), H63D (G at rs1799945 instead of C), and S65C (T at i3002468 instead of A). At least 17 other mutations in the HFE gene have been linked to HH. 60-90% of people with HH have two copies of the C282Y mutation. The H63D mutation is also quite common&#8212;about 20% of people carry a copy of the mutation, and about 3% have two copies. This mutation is not as severe as the C282Y mutation, and only causes symptoms when someone has both the H63D and the C282Y mutations. Even then, only a small fraction of people with one copy of each mutation actually exhibit evidence of iron overload. Additionally, those who have two copies of H63D do not exhibit any symptoms and are not at risk for iron overload. The S65C mutation is less common, and will also only cause symptoms if in combination with C282Y. For both H63D/C282Y and S65C/C282Y single mutation individuals, symptoms are usually mild if they develop at all.==Influence on Iron Levels==HH has four main pathophysiological mechanisms : the increased absorption of dietary iron in the upper intestine, 2) decreased expression of hepcidin, 3) altered function of the HFE protein, and 4) tissue injury and fibrogenesis induced by iron. Since the HFE gene encodes for proteins that affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis, this mechanism will be further explained in more detail. The HFE gene regulates the liver protein hepcidin, which is considered to be the principal iron-regulatory hormone. Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.==Symptoms of Hereditary Hemochromatosis==The symptoms of HH depend on the person&#8217;s mutation as well as their sex and diet. The older a person, the more likely iron has accumulated in the body over time. Typically, complications may develop later in life between the ages of 40 and 60 in men and in post-menopausal women. If symptoms do develop, these are typically seen in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and testes. At first, one may feel symptoms such as joint pain and stiffness, fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Later symptoms may lead to more serious conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, liver failure, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and arthritis.====Symptomatic Findings in Patients with HH==== Liver- hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver failure Joints- arthritis, swelling, chondrocalcinosis Heart- dilated cardiomyopathy, CHF Skin- increased pigmentation Endocrine- testicular atrophy, hypogonadism Hypothyroidism</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1614">rs225014, also known as Thr92Ala, represents a variant in the deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II DIO2 gene on chromosome 14. In dbSNP orientation for this SNP, the more common (T) allele encodes the Thr (threonine) and the somewhat less common (C) allele encodes the Ala (alanine) at this position in the DIO2 protein.Polymorphisms in this SNP have associations with various conditions in the literature: osteoarthritis, psychological disorders, reduced thyroid hormone metabolism, Type 2 diabetes, and various other conditions.==Osteoarthritis== A 2012 article titled "Increased type II deiodinase protein in OA-affected cartilage and allelic imbalance of OA risk polymorphism rs225014 at DIO2 in human OA joint tissues" identified that the minor 'C' allele was associated with a significant, 1.3-fold higher risk of osteoarthritis (OA) relative to the 'T' allele. A 2008 article titled "Identification of DIO2 as a new susceptibility locus for symptomatic osteoarthritis" explained that "Confirmation and replication by association in the additional osteoarthritis studies indicated a common DIO2 haplotype, exclusively containing the minor allele of rs225014 and common allele of rs12885300, with a combined recessive odds ratio of 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-2.34 with P = 2.02 x 10(-5) in female cases with advanced/symptomatic hip osteoarthritis." (Abstract)==Psychological disorders==. Published 2015. Abstract stated "The specific variant of the DIO2 gene, namely the CC genotype of the Thr92Ala polymorphism, was more frequently found in healthy subjects than in patients with depression, what suggests that it could potentially serve as a marker of a lower risk for recurrent depressive disorder. The distribution of four haplotypes was also significantly different between the two study groups with the TC (Thr-Gly) haplotype more frequently detected in patients with depression." (Abstract). Published 2009. This study analyzed "(ORFa)-Gly3Asp (rs12885300) and Thr92Ala (rs225014) with potential functions on the activity of DIO2." Findings in abstract: "Both SNPs were significantly higher in the BPAD (Bipolar disorder) patients, with odds ratios of 1.489 ... and 1.616 ... respectively. Individuals with two copies of the variant 3Gly or 92Ala were at greater risk of BPAD.... Haplotypes ORFa-3Asp-92Ala and ORFa-3Gly-92Ala indicated higher susceptibility for BPAD with odds ratios of 3.759 (95% CI=2.013-7.020) and 1.292 (95% CI=1.017-1.642), respectively, while ORFa-3Asp-92Thr probably played a protective role with an odds ratio of 0.395 (95% CI=0.284-0.549)." (Abstract)==Thyroid hormone metabolism and treatment for hypothyroidism==. According to a 2009 study of 500 patients, hypothyroid patients on LT4 (Levothyroxine) therapy who don't show much improvement may have lower brain thyroid levels (not reflected in their serum levels) correlated to the number of rs225014(C) alleles they carry, and these patients may benefit from combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy.  "The Thr92AlaD2 Polymorphism May Play a Novel Role in Hypothyroidism" by Elizabeth A McAninch, Antonio C Bianco, US Endocrinology, 2015;11(2):92–4 DOI: . This article stated "A prevalent polymorphism in D2, Thr92AlaD2, has been associated with improved well-being on “combination therapy” with T4+T3; the underlying mechanism is unclear as T4-to-T3 conversion appears normal. Novel studies indicate this might be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. If the relationship between Thr92AlaD2-expression and treatment preference is confirmed, personalized medicine may play a role in hypothyroidism." (Abstract)However, as of 2016, controversy continued about the value of testing for and treating polymorphisms of this SNP.  See the liothyronine page for further references.==Type 2 Diabetes==. Published 2010. Published 2011.  Abstract stated "Patients carrying D2 Ala/Ala genotype had a higher fasting plasma insulin and HOMA(IR) index as compared to patients carrying Thr/Ala or Thr/Thr genotypes (P = 0.022 and P = 0.001, respectively). A significant synergistic effect was observed between D2 Thr92Ala and PPARγ2 Pro12Ala polymorphisms on HOMA(IR) index, with carriers of both D2 Ala/Ala genotype and PPARγ2 Ala12 allele showing the highest HOMA(IR) values, after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, and use of medication for DM2 (P = 0.010)." ==Various conditions==.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3165">rs2279744, a variant in the promoter of the MDM2 gene and also known as "-410T-G", "SNP309", and "SNP309T>G", has been studied for several years to determine it's role in cancer origin and treatment. The interest primarily stems from the ability of the MDM2 protein to bind to and thereby enhance the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein known as p53. Studies on rs2279744 include:  rs2279744(G) carriers in individuals with cancer tend to develop such cancers on average 12 years earlier than those lacking this allele, and the frequency of rs2279744(G) was greatly increased in those who developed soft tissue sarcomas at a young age.   Individuals with one or more rs2279744(G) alleles who are also carriers of the TP53 rs1042522(C) (arg at aa72) SNP tend to develop cancers earlier than rs2279744(T;T) homozygotes who carry the same p53 SNP.   rs2279744(T;T) individuals who have a mutant p53 (in their tumors) are at an increased risk of death (risk ratio RR of death = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.08 to 5.03). Tumor p53 status was not associated with breast cancer survival among rs2279744(G;T) or rs2279744(G;G) genotypes.   rs2279744 showed no association with nonsmall cell lung cancer risk in a study of 1,787 Caucasian patients. However, a possible association between nonsmoking (G;G) homozygotes and a higher risk of nonsmall cell lung cancer was reported.  A study in Chinese leukemia patients found that the rs2279744(G) allele was unexpectedly associated with reduced risk.  Another study concludes that this SNP on its own has little or no effect on the risk of common cancers, but it might modify the time of tumor onset and prognosis.   rs2279744(G;G) females are at a 2.76x increased risk (CI: 1.06-7.20, p=0.03) for endometrial cancer compared to (G;T) or (T;T) genotypes based on a study of 73 patients and matched controls.  A study of 148 individuals with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing first-line chemotherapy, such as the irinotecan plus cisplatin regimen, concluded after multivariate analysis that the rs2279744(T;T) genotype was independently predictive for longer survival (HR = 1.742, p = .032).   The rs2279744(G;G) genotype was associated with high grade breast cancer tumors (with an odds ratio of 1.64, CI:1.06-2.53, p=0.025) and greater nodal involvement (OR=2.51, CI:1.26-4.98, p=0.009), but was not associated with an earlier age of cancer diagnosis or even risk of breast cancer, in a study of ~300 Scottish Caucasian patients.  Around 300 cases each of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma were studied relative to this SNP. No significant associations were found between rs2279744 and any of these three types of skin cancer. However, compared with the (T;T) genotype, the adjusted odds ratios of having moles on the arms for (G;T) and (G;G) genotypes was 0.92 (CI: 0.78-1.08) and 0.68 (CI: 0.53-0.87), respectively (p, trend, 0.005).  rs2279744(G;G) women are diagnosed with melanoma 13 years earlier than women who carry one or no G alleles. Note that this SNP does not cause higher risk of melanoma; it affects only the age at diagnosis of melanoma in women and has no effect in men, as reported in the 23andMe blog / 23andMe blog.  Odds ratio for (G;G) 3x, for (G;T) 2x, for breast cancer in a study of 124 Taiwanese patients, along with a correlation towards earlier occurence.  rs117039649, also known as SNP285C, a second MDM2 SNP found on the SNP305G allele (and only in Caucasians), reduces the risk of both ovarian and breast cancer among SNP309G holders (odds ratio 0.74 and 0.79, respectively), compared to SNP309G holders lacking this (second) SNP./ 23andMe blog rs2279744(G) has been associated with earlier onset for some cancers, including soft tissue sarcoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in women, and decreased survival in people with stomach and kidney cancer.  But there is evidence for improved survival in women with ovarian cancer who have the G version of this SNP.  Paradoxically, higher levels of the MDM2 protein (as would be expected with the G version of SNP rs2279744 shown to lead to earlier melanoma onset in the current study) have been associated with improved survival for melanoma.  rs2279744 is not associated with SLE in a study of Caucasians, African-Americans, and Asian children and adults.  rs2279744, rs1042522, rs17878362 and rs1625895 associated with high grade endometrial cancer</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1451">rs1799853 is a SNP in the CYP2C9 gene and is linked to poor warfarin metabolism and risk of GI bleeding with some NSAID drugs. The common nomenclature for this polymorphism is CYP2C9 2 (Cys amino acid, T allele; the SNP is also known as C430T or Cys144Arg). Advanced knowledge of this may influence initial warfarin dosing by physicians. Warfarin is monitored through INR (international normalized ratio) and proper dosing is influenced by a variety of factors including warfarin metabolism and diet.  The rs1799853(T) allele encodes a variant amino acid, cysteine, which has been linked to poor metabolism of warfarin and thus sensitivity. The CYP2C9 2 allele is also associated with higher sensitivity to the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin. Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) mention concurrent testing for the HLA-B 15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN). The effect of CYP2C9 variants on drug metabolism should not be predicted without also considering CYP2C9 3, defined as the common loss of function variant rs1057910(C)  (NM_000771:c.430C>T, NP_000762:p.144R>C) /. In a 2009 article titled "Genetically based impairment in CYP2C8- and CYP2C9-dependent NSAID metabolism as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding: is a combination of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics required to improve personalized medicine?" Authors reviewed prior research that argued: Individuals carrying minor alleles of this both CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 AND CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) have increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib.  In addition, carriers of the risk allele for CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 have decreased metabolism of Ibuprofen, Flurbiprofen, Piroxicam, and Tenoxicam.   The presence of CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 allele alone does not confer risk with Diclofenac, but when it is combined with CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080), Diclofenac induces hepatoxicity and confers risk of GI bleeding.    In a 2008 article (reviewed in ) titled "Interaction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes modifies the risk for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related acute gastrointestinal bleeding," the study discovered that carriers of CYP2C8 3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a GI bleeding event risk OR=1.81 (95% CI=0.95–3.46; P=0.071) and risk increased if carriers drank more than 20g alcohol/day to an OR=1.99 (95% CI=1.06–3.74; P=0.034). As CYP2C8 3 and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium, patients are likely to carry the risk allele to both 8 3 and 9 2, and when they do, The OR (95% CI) for carriers of such a genotype is increased to 1.94 (1.13–3.33), P=0.017.   A 2013 NIH review titled "PharmGKB summary: very important pharmacogene information for cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8" reiterated that "some data suggest that the combined presence of minor risk alleles CYP2C8 3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080) and CYP2C9 2 rs1799853 is a determinant of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding."

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1312">rs231775, also known as +49A>G (or CTLA-4 A49G), is a polymorphism of the CTLA4 gene. Polymorphisms are associated with several autoimmune diseases, especially autoimmune thyroiditis, as well as several other disorders.   A 2017 study titled "CD28/CTLA-4/ICOS haplotypes confers susceptibility to Graves’ disease and modulates clinical phenotype of disease" found that rs5742909 CC and rs231775 G allele "were associated with the family burden of GD" (Graves' disease, a form of Autoimmune thyroiditis).  The G allele at rs231775 did not affect risk for Graves' Orbitopathy (GO), but favored severe disease outcome for GO. The presence of the A allele "was significantly associated with sporadic GD." A 2016 study titled "Association of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4 (CTLA4) Gene Polymorphisms with Autoimmune Thyroid Disease in Children and Adults: Case-Control Study" found that in a Han Chinese population, rs231775 "Genotype G/G conferred a risk of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.20–2.02; Pc = 0.002) for GD (Graves' disease) in adults and of 1.56 (95% CI, 1.19–2.05; Pc = 0.002) in children. Allele G was significantly associated with GD (Graves' disease) in adults (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.21–1.84; Pc < 0.001) and in children (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.15–1.77; Pc = 0.002)." A 2016 study titled "Association of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) and Thyroglobulin (TG) Genetic Variants with Autoimmune Hypothyroidism" sampled 84 hypothyroidism patients and 62 controls from Gujarat, India. Researchers found that CTLA4 Exon1 (+49A/G) rs231775 polymorphisms increased the odds of autoimmune hypothyroidism in their sample: Odds ratios were   for AA, 1.0 (Genotypes were similar between patients and controls)  for AG, 5.333 (95%CI 2.043 to 13.92, p=0.0004) compared to AA  for GG, 5.778  (95%CI 1.829 to 18.25, p=0.0004) compared to AAThey also discovered that polymorphisms of rs231775 were associated with significantly decreased mRNA expression of both full length (flCTLA4) and soluble (sCTLA4) transcripts.   AA genotypes were similar between patients and controls.  AG decreased expression of both significantly (by p = 0.0141 for flCTLA4, and by p = 0.0358 for sCTLA4) in patients compared to controls  GG decreased expression levels slightly (by p = 0.0007 for flCTLA4, and by p = 0.0102 for sCTLA4) in patients compared to controlsThey also found significant differences in patients vs. controls when analyzing the TG exon 33 SNP rs2076740. A 2014 study titled "The association of PTPN22 rs2476601 polymorphism and CTLA-4 rs231775 polymorphism with LADA  risks: a systematic review and meta-analysis" examined Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) and found that "The minor T allele at rs2476601 and the minor G at rs231775 carried estimated relative risks (odds ratio) of 1.52 (95 % CI 1.29–1.79) and 1.39 (95 % CI 1.11–1.74), respectively. These alleles contributed to an absolute lowering of the risk of all LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults) by 4.88 and 14.93 % when individuals do not carry these alleles." Researchers stated that "LADA accounts for 2–12 % of all cases of diabetes" but "The progression to insulin dependence in LADA patients is believed more rapidly than classic type 2 diabetes patients" and "8–10 % of patients diagnosed with T2D are in fact misdiagnosed LADA."  A 2015 study titled "Association between CTLA-4 rs231775 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility" revealed that "The frequencies of genotype AA and allele A in CTLA-4 rs231775 polymorphism were significantly higher in cases" of liver cancer than the control group (AA vs. GG: OR=2.81, P=0.043; A vs. G: OR=1.63, P=0.022). Meanwhile, the genetic expression level of CTLA-4 was remarkably higher in cases compared with the controls. The association analysis indicated that AA genotype carriers exhibited highest level of CTLA-4 (P<0.01)."   A 2015 study titled "Associations between CTLA-4 +49 A/G (rs231775) polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis based on 52 case-control studies" stated "This meta-analysis suggests that the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism may be a protective factor for cancer."  The minor G allele decreased cancer risk overall and for a large number of cancer types, "especially for breast cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers, epithelial tumor, respiratory system cancer, reproductive and breast cancer, malignant bone tumor," "but not digestive system cancer, hematopoietic malignancy and skin cancer." Most of the decreased cancer risk was in Asian populations. Table 3 data demonstrated "association between the risk of cancer and the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism (GG+AG vs. AA)." Although most of the Asian data showed "decreased risk," a few studies showed extreme increased risk, and these data skewed the average OD. On average, the data showed 0.85 OD of decreased cancer risk overall (0.98 for Caucasians and 0.76 for Asians). In this 2008 article, researchers reported that "One of the best demonstrations of the power of subset analysis is the CTLA-4 gene in T1D. Although CTLA-4 showed very weak association with T1D, when analyzed in the subset of patients with both T1D and AITD, the genetic effect of CTLA-4 was significantly stronger." Note: rs231775 is one SNP within the CTLA-4 gene.. Published 2012. From abstract: "The combined results showed that there were significant differences in genotype distribution between SLE cases and control on the basis of all studies, GG versus AA (OR = 1.53, 95 % CI: 1.12-2.10), GG versus GA/AA (OR = 1.30, 95 % CI: 1.04-1.64), GG versus GA (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.55). When stratifying for the race, the phenomenon was found that SLE cases had a significantly higher frequency of GG/GA versus AA (OR = 1.58, 95 % CI: 1.23-2.03), GG versus AA (OR = 1.89, 95 % CI: 1.23-2.91), GG versus GA/AA(OR = 1.39, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.89), GA versus AA(OR = 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.06-1.80) and G versus A(OR = 1.34, 95 % CI: 1.07-1.67) than control in Asians." (Abstract) rs231775 (CTLA4_+49_G/A P=0.0219) and rs733618 (CTLA4_-1722_T/C P=0.0096) susceptibility to Graves' disease associated with the development of placental abruption and preeclampsia, with women having the G allele being at risk rs231775 was not associated with type-1 diabetes in a study of 207 Portuguese patients.In a meta-analysis of CTLA4 gene SNPs, rs231775 was most associated with vitiligo; however, the association seems to hold only in the subgroup of patients with other autoimmune diseases.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5051">This SNP in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene, rs1800629, is also known as the TNF-308 SNP. Occasionally the rs1800629(A) allele is referred to as 308.2 or TNF2, with the more common (G) allele being 308.1 or TNF1. The (A) allele is associated with higher levels of TNF expression. This SNP has been linked to a wide variety of conditions:  Allograft rejection   Among 72 Polish patients receiving a kidney transplant, the risk of acute kidney allograft rejection was 2.5x higher among rs1800629(A) carriers compared to (G;G) homozygotes (CI: 1.19- 5.37, p<.05).   Asthma   A meta-analysis of ~2,500 patients combined indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele was associated with a 1.46x increased risk for asthma.    In a study of ~600 Mexican families and their asthmatic children, rs1800629(A) carriers had an increased risk of asthma (relative risk = 1.54, CI: 1.04-2.28), especially among children of non-smoking parents (odds then 2.06, CI: 1.19-3.55, p for interaction = 0.09).    In a study of Norwegian children, nonallergic asthma was associated with rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio 1.7, CI: 1.3-2.3).   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   A meta-analysis of 36 publications totaling ~5,000 patients concluded that the association between the rs1800629(A) allele and the risk of COPD was statistically significant for Asians (odds ratio 2.36, CI: 1.84 - 3.02, p < 0.0001) but not for Caucasians.  Crohn's disease   In a study of 235 Portuguese patients, the rs1800629(A;A) genotype was associated with higher susceptibility to Crohn's disease, with an odds ratio of 3.0 (CI: 1.2-7.2). These homozygotes also showed more disease-related complications.   Exfoliation glaucoma (XFG)   A study of 204 patients with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) concluded that rs1800629 is unlikely to be a major risk factor for XFG in Caucasians.   Graves' disease   A meta-analysis of 10 case-control studies, including over 2,200 Graves' disease cases, concluded that rs1800629(A) carriers were associated with this type of hyperthyroidism.   Heart disease   A study of 600 Italian patients concluded that rs1800629(A) carriers are at increased risk for acute heart attack and have other markers of heart disease. The odd ratio was 1.86, CI: 1.08-3.21, p=0.027).    A study of 50 Egyptian children with rheumatic heart disease found increased risk associated with the rs1800629(A;A) homozygotes, with odds ratio = 5.7, p<0.001. However, there was a significantly lower frequency of heterozygous genotypes.     However, a 2016 meta-analysis including 12 publications consisting of 6000+ cases found no significant association between rs1800629 and risk for myocardial infarction.  Ischemic stroke   A meta-analysis of 18 studies with 8075 patients found no significant association between ischemic stroke and the TNFα-308G/A, except potentially in a subgroup of East Asians.  Leprosy   A study of 37 Thai patients with leprosy found that the rs1800629(A) allele was more common (odds ratio = 2.69, p=0.04). PMID 17624216}  Liver disease   A study of 108 Chinese patients concludes that rs1800629(A) carriers are at 3.23x (CI: 1.10-9.44) increased risk for liver cancer and are also at higher risk for hepatic fibrosis and more severe liver damage.    Lymphoma   A study of 194 Tunisian patients indicated an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma among rs1800629(A;A) genotypes, at an odds ratio of 3.63, p=0.028.    A study of 441 incident non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases indicated that, compared with the wild-type rs1800629(G;G), the (A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk (odds ratio 2.14, CI: 0.94-4.85), whereas the (A;G) genotype was not. This association was similar for follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.    A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. Five SNPs in two cytokine genes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha, were associated with a 1.31x increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63; P = 0.01) and with a 1.64x increase in the subtype known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23-2.19; P = 0.0007). The other four SNPS are listed below. The cytokine genes affect inflammatory and innate immune responses.    rs361525    rs1799724    rs909253    rs2239704  Susceptibility to Mediterranean spotted fever   Although cytokine genes affect immune response to infection, in a Sicilian population the rs1800629 polymorphism did not affect susceptibility to Mediterranean spotted fever.   Migraine   Polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene may be associated with migraine and cardiovascular disease. The rs1800629 SNP has not been found significant.   Multiple sclerosis (MS)   A study of 300 Croatian and Slovenian patients indicated that rs1800629(A) carriers might be at lower risk for multiple sclerosis.   Nasal polyps   The rs1800629(A;G) genotype was associated with increased risk for nasal polyps in a study of 82 Turkish patients.     Another study found a nearly doubled risk for rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio, 1.86; confidence interval, 1.4-3.09).   Psoriasis   A study of 160 Polish patients indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele frequency was significantly decreased among patients with early-onset psoriasis (7.5% vs. 15.4%, p=0.022).    In contrast, 147 Irish patients with psoriasis were studied and the results indicated that the rs1800629(A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk as well as earlier onset of psoriasis.   Rheumatoid arthritis - response to TNF-alpha inhibitors   2009 meta-analysis of 9 studies concludes rs1800629(A) allele carriers respond less well to TNF-alpha inhibitors when being treated for rheumatoid arthritis.   Sarcoidosis   In a pooled analysis of seven case-control studies, the odds ratio for sarcoidosis for carriers of the rs1800629(A) allele was either 1.47 (CI 1.03-2.08 under a dominant model) or 1.39 (CI: 0.67-2.90; under a recessive model).   Susceptibility to sepsis   A study of 159 patients with severe trauma indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele was associated with higher risk of developing sepsis and of dying (odds ratio 7.65, two-sided p = 1.9 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). The authors of this research suggest that preemptive anti-inflammatory interventions should be developed for use in carriers of this SNP should they suffer severe injuries.    A meta-analysis of 25 studies concluded that while rs1800629 status is significantly associated with risk for sepsis, especially among Asians, it was not associated with mortality from sepsis. However, there may be an increased risk for fatal outcomes among Asians (odds ratio 10.75, CI: 3-39, p < 0.01).  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)   A study of 120 Columbian patients with SLE found an increased risk for rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio 3.9, CI: 1.65-5.80, p= 0.0004).    A meta-analysis of 21 studies indicated that in European populations, the rs1800629(A) allele is associated with increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In Europeans, the oodds ratio for the (A;A) genotype was 4.0, CI: 2.5-6.4, p<0.001. No association was detected in Asian-derived populations. The overall odds ratio for rs1800629(A) carriers was 2.0 (CI: 1.3-3.1, p<0.001).</p>
