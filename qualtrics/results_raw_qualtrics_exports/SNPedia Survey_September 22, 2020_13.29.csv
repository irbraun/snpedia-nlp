Correlation between genetic polymorphisms"",5465],[""28"",""rs1045642, also known as C3435T, is a SNP located in the ABCB1 gene. It is often studied in conjunction with rs2032582. C3435T has been mentioned by: A \""Silent\"" Polymorphism in the MDR1 Gene Changes Substrate Specificity (for example, to verapamil) (R)-lansoprazole (Prevacid) concentrations are significantly increased in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers with ABCB1 C3435T C allele. In a Korean population, plasma concentrations of fexofenadine (Allegra) were 17% lower in 2677AA/3435CC subjects and 47% higher in the 2677TT/3435TT subjects compared to 2677GG/3435CC subjects. In contrast, in this study no association was observed between the C3435T polymorphism and fexofenadine plasma or urine concentrations in a German Caucasian population. A meta-analysis including 9 case-control studies (totaling ~2,500 patients) found no association between rs1045642 and epilepsy riskA study of 98 methadone-maintaining patients concluded that the higher (>150 mg/day) and lower (< or =150 mg/day) methadone dose groups differed significantly in their rs1128503 status (experiment-wise p = 0.0325). Furthermore, individuals with the 3-locus genotype pattern (T;T)-(T;T)-(T;T) for SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503, respectively, had an approximately 5-fold chance of requiring the 'higher' methadone dose, while individuals heterozygous for these three SNPs have an approximately 3-fold chance of stabilizing at the 'lower' methadone dose (point-wise p-value = 0.026).
