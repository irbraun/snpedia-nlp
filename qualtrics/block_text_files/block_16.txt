        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5139">rs1800462, also known as A80P, is a rare SNP in the TPMT gene, potentially encoding a variant incapable of detoxifying byproducts of certain antineoplastic and immunosuppressant drugs. In general, individuals must have two nonfunctioning TPMT alleles for the toxicity to be pronounced.The risk allele for this SNP (in orientation to the dbSNP entry) is rs1800462(C), and it encodes the TPMT 2 allele. It may occur at a frequency of 1 in 200 alleles among Caucasians.| wikipedia thiopurine drugs metabolized by TPMT include azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine</p>

The odds ratio was reported as 8.13 (p = 2.8 × 10e−14). The mutation was also associated with increased risk of cancer in general and an overall reduced average lifespan of 3.6 years.</p>

In summary, the rare rs34677591(A) allele is either a a low-penetrance mutation or a rare polymorphism. The cancers most often mentioned in association with G12S are paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. The G12S mutation has also been associated with increased manganese superoxide dismutase expression.For a good summary of the studies involved, see OMIM  602690.0011.</p>

Note that inheritance was neither dominant or recessive; this variant increased the risk of stuttering when present in either one or two copies, consistent with an additive genetic effect. Female homozygotes were apparently less affected. Note that the proportion of stutterers likely to carry a GNPTAB variant is likely to be less than 4%.</p>

The Methionine synthase takes a methyl group from methyl folate and attaches it to its B12, then it attaches it to a molecule of homocysteine, turning it into methionine, which in turn becomes SAMe. After 1000-2000 times doing this, the B12 gets turned into a useless form, and MTRR turns the B12 back into the useful form so that the molecule of MTR can keep working.

The associated allele is also known as CYP2D6 6, and there are several subtypes but they are all nonfunctional.If two copies of this (or similar) changes are inherited, CYP2D6 poor metabolism ('PM') is observed. CYP2D6 poor metabolism may affect the efficacy or degree of side effects of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, such as dextromorphan, sparteine, nortriptyline, venlafaxine and codeine.
