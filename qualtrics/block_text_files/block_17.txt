        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4599">rs117767867 is a SNP in the SLC16A11 gene on chromosome 17. This SNP, rs117767867 is considered the tag SNP for a haplotype consisting of 4 missense variants identified as relatively common in the Native American population and having introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals. The other 3 missense variants are rs13342692, rs75418188, and rs75493593. This haplotype raises the risk by 25% in heterozygotes and 50% in homozygotes for type-2 diabetes, and it may also lead to the development of type-2 diabetes at a younger age and lower BMI. This haplotype is found at ~50% frequency in Native American samples and ~10% in east Asian, but is rare in Europeans and Africans.</p>

This variant may also be known as tau-A152.Publications have linked the rare rs143624519(A) allele to somewhat increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases. As stated  here on AlzForum, "Unlike the majority of pathogenic mutations in MAPT, the A152T variant does not appear to cause autosomal-dominant disease. Instead, it acts as a risk modifier and increases susceptibility to several neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies". The odds ratios vary between conditions - and publications - but range between about 2 to 6.</p>

Targeted exome sequencing lipid-modifying genes in 328 individuals with extremely high plasma HDL-C levels led to the discovery of a rs74830677(T;T) homozygote. In a total of 852 individuals with high HDL-C compared to 1,156 with low HDL-C, the rs74830677(T) allele was significantly over-represented and, surprisingly, it was also associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (odds ratio 1.79, p<0.0001). A carrier of the (T) allele appears to have a higher HDL-C of 8.4mg/dl on average. The variant allele was also said to apparently be relatively specific to Ashkenazi Jews.</p>

The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02.

This also meant that each rs16991615(G) allele yielded an odds ratio of 1.85 (CI: 1.51&#8211;2.2, p = 1.45 x 10e-9) of early menopause, defined as occurring before the age of 46.Overall, women homozygous for the "early" alleles at all 4 SNPs found in this study were ~4 times more likely to undergo menopause early compared to women who had a total of 3 or less risk alleles. However, the ability to predict which women will actually undergo early menopause using these 4 SNPs is still low.  see also / 23andMe blog</p>

However, rs1057868(T;T) individuals had a 1.6x increased CYP3A activity compared to rs1057868(C) carriers (n=182, p=0.004), and the finding was replicated in a second independent dataset.

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4576">rs727428 is a SNP in the sex-hormone binding globulin SHBG gene. SHBG binds steroid hormones, mostly testosterone and estradiol, rendering them biologically unavailable.  Based on a study of 758 women in 430 families, rs727428 is associated with levels of that sex-hormone binding globulin hormone, independent of the effects of insulin resistance and obesity. Specifically, levels of SHBG were decreased approximately 13% in (A;G) heterozygotes and 27% in (A;A) homozygotes compared with (G;G) homozygotes. Note: designation of alleles is as shown in dbSNP.  Haplotype analysis suggested that rs858518, rs727428, or a variant in linkage disequilibrium with them acts to decrease SHBG levels but that this effect is neutralized by rs6259.

The authors speculate this increased risk of adenoma recurrence (and an association with colorectal cancer) may be related to SNP-associated differences in alcohol and fat intake./ 23andMe blog Alcoholism related rs1799971(A;A) severe alcoholism 2x  rs1799732(I;I) severe alcoholism 1.85x</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4970">genetic risk for poor reading performance.Rs2143340, a SNP in the TTRAP gene, is in a region that crops up in several independent studies as likely to associated with dyslexia. The risk allele in the US/UK Caucasian populations studied is (C), and it is indicative of a risk haplotype found in ~18% of the general population but up to ~28% of severely dyslexic individuals. It is not thought that rs2143340 is a functional SNP; instead, it marks the haplotype known as rs4504469-rs2038137-rs2143340 "1-1-2" since the other two SNPs are the common forms whereas the significant form for rs2143340 is the rare form. The functional effect of this haplotype appears to be on the KIAA0319 gene, in that KIAA0319 gene activity associated with the 1-1-2 risk haplotype is 40% lower than for other haplotypes, and other genes aren't noticeably affected.</p>

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2158">This SNP in the GABRA2 gene has been linked to Alcoholism. The effect of this SNP, a synonymous change at amino acid residue 132, is unknown, but it does not change the GABRA2 protein sequence.Carriers of at least one rs279858(G) allele respond slower to the effects of alcohol and are thereby apparently more prone to alcoholism than carriers of two rs279858(A) alleles. Finasteride, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy and a modulator of GABRA2, was shown to have more of a blocking effect on rs279858(A) homozygotes. Note that nearby SNPs have been grouped into a haplotype that shows statistically stronger association with alcohol dependence, namely the haplotype consisting of the rs279871(A) + rs279845(T) + rs279836(A) alleles . 1050 nicotine-dependent cases and 879 non-dependent smoking controls rs279858 and rs16859834 aka rs2229940</p>

A study of 1,000+ breast cancer patients showed a 0.77x decreased risk of breast cancer for carriers of a CYP2C19 17 allele (CI: 0.65-0.93, p = 0.005). Analysis of a subgroup of such carriers who were using hormone therapy for ten years or longer showed an even stronger effect (odds ratio 0.57, CI: 0.39-0.83, p = 0.003).

The risk shown for this SNP is actually the risk calculated for the tightly associated SNP rs1219648.The distinguishing feature of rs7895676 is experimental evidence indicating that it is one of two SNPs in this intron that appear to have a (the?) functional role associated with the transcriptional regulation of the FGFR2 gene. The minor alleles of both SNPs, rs7895676 and rs2981578, lead to increased transcription and increased breast cancer risk.

We identified one risk haplotype (GGGG; P=0.017) and one protective haplotype (AAAA; P=0.007) for development of CAD. Further analysis suggested that the SNPs probably confer susceptibility to CAD in a dominance model (covariates-adjusted P=0.001 to 0.024; OR=2.37 to 1.54). Also found to be significant in a study of 416 Italian myocardial infarction patients. Found to be associated with coronary heart disease in a study of 1360 Chinese Han patients, with an odds ratio of 1.52 (CI: 1.13 - 2.04) for rs2383207(G;G) individuals.

This mutation is a missense mutation causing the loss of function of its gene product, the LXRA protein.Based on a study of seven multiple sclerosis patients from two families presenting with severe, progessive disease (and an average onset of 34 years), the rs61731956(A) allele was estimated to be causative for multiple sclerosis, with individuals carrying this mutation having a 70% chance of developing the disease. The authors note that "the presence of seemingly unaffected obligate carriers and one male sibling at age 55 indicates that the penetrance of the mutation is incomplete, and additional genetic or environmental factors may be required for the onset of MS".However  comments in pubmed on the original article and then a replication analysis in a much larger sample collection  strongly suggest this is not real.</p>
