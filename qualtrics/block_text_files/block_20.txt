        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3678">rs53576 is a silent G to A change in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with the G allele are more empathetic, feel less lonely, employ more sensitive parenting techniques, and have lower rates of autism (discussed in )The blog / Not Exactly Rocket Science discusses that Americans with (G;G) tend to be more sensitive parents, more empathetic and less lonely than those with an &#8216;A&#8217;. In a Korean population people with (G;G) were less likely to seek support from their peers.  Culture, distress, and oxytocin receptor polymorphism (OXTR) interact to influence emotional support seeking. Oxytocin receptor genetic variation relates to empathy and stress reactivity in humans. In brief, people with the G;G genotype were better able to discern the emotional state of others than those who carried the A-allele (/ blog summary found here).  The study encompassed 192 participants of both sexes and mixed ethnicities. The study subjects underwent a number of tests to determine their level of empathy and stress reactivity. They found that G;G individuals performed significantly better on the behavioral measure of empathy and were 22.7% less likely to make a mistake on the "Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test" (RMET) (a behavioural measure of empathic accuracy) than A;A/A;G individuals (P = 0.005). Similarly, G;G individuals reported higher levels of dispositional empathy than A;A/A;G individuals: mean (SE) = 3.69 (0.06) and 3.53 (0.04) for G;G and A;A/A;G, respectively (P = 0.025), and were less affected by stress (as measured by their heart rates): mean (SE) = 72.1 (0.54) and 78.4 (1.19) for G;G and A;A/A;G, respectively. Associations between the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and affect, loneliness and intelligence in normal subjects. This study examined the association between the OXTR gene and parenting. A total of 176 mothers of toddlers were included in the study. After controlling for marital discord, depression, and education status, rs53576 was found to significantly correlate with parenting, with the G;G genotype being associated with a significantly more sensitive parenting style than A;A or A;G genotypes. However, they concluded that the major factor influencing parenting was the maternal education level. Forty-five female subjects (17 twin pairs and 11 twins without their sibling) were genotyped and tested for their ability to hear and understand conversations in noisy environments. Participants with the G;G genotype reported less difficulty hearing and understanding (difficulty hearing total score Mean (SD), 9.2 (4.2)) than participants with A;A/A;G genotypes (13.9 (3.8); p < 0.001). Even after adjusting for age, the relationship between genotype and difficulty hearing scores was still significant (p = 0.003). Two hundred three healthy German male university students (mean age 23.2 y, SD 2.9 y) were subjected to a mock interview and their saliva cortisol levels were tested before and at a number of time points after the interview. Half of the participants were told to bring a female friend as social support, whereas the other half came alone to the interview. The authors found that subjects carrying the G allele (G;G or A;G genotypes) had significantly lower cortisol responses to stress when they had social support (P < 0.01). Conversely, there were no differences in cortisol levels in subjects with the A;A genotype receiving or not receiving social support (P = 0.46). Moreover, there was a trend (P = 0.08) for people with the A;A genotype to display higher levels of cortisol throughout the session than G carriers (no differences between the genotypes were observed at baseline)./ 23andMe blog discusses the snp./ blogs.scientificamerican discusses the snp. In this study, 345 healthy subjects were examined by multimodal neuroimaging techniques to identify structural and functional alterations in OXTR risk allele carriers and their link to temperament. The authors found that there was a significant association between the different rs53576 genotypes and grey matter volume in the hypothalamus, with the hypothalamus volume being significantly larger in G;G carriers than in A;A carriers (P = 0.012). Moreover, they investigated the relationship between rs53576 and reward dependence (RD) using the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, and found that the G;G, G;A, and A;A genotypes were associated with the highest, intermediate, and lowest RD values, respectively (G;G vs. A;A, p=0.02; A;G vs. A;A, p=0.07). Lastly, they also demonstrated that rs53576 is associated with amygdala activation, with the A;A genotype being associated with a significant reduction in activation compared to the G;G genotype (p=0.036); and with the functional relationship between the amygdala and the hypothalamus, with A;A carrier having a significantly increased functional correlation (p=0.036). The authors concluded that there is likely a neural mechanism linking both structural and neural signalling alterations in the oxytocinergic system to individual differences in emotional reactivity and prosocial temperament. This study found that there is no association between rs53576 variants and the risk of autism in Caucasian children and adolescents.Followup:</p>

    [[ID:q1104]]
    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1104">Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in populations with European ancestry:  the average carrier frequency is 1:25. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). The CFTR gene encodes a chloride transporter, gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. It regulates the transport of chloride and other ions across the cell membrane. Mutations in CFTR result in raised sweat chloride, respiratory infections, and pancreatic insufficiency.To date, 1939 mutations in the CFTR gene that cause cystic fibrosis have been curated in the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database. Different combinations of mutations in the gene have different effects on its function and thus cause different disease phenotypes. The most common mutation is deltaF508, which is present in about 70% of the cystic fibrosis patients. '''i4000320''', also known as 2789+5G>A and as rs80224560 to the rest of the world (outside of 23andMe), is a rare mutation in the CFTR gene located at position 117242922 of chromosome 7 that causes a mild form of cystic fibrosis . The risk allele is '''i4000320''' (A). Because cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive inherited disease, one needs to carry two defective copies of the CFTR gene to develop the disease. Most commonly, patients harboring the 2789+5G>A variant will be compound heterozygotes carrying other CFTR mutations.Highsmith ''et al'' first identified the '''i4000320''' SNP in 1997  in a study of eight CF patients in a single inbred family. Three of them were homozygous for the '''i4000320''' mutation, and the rest were compound heterozygotes, harboring both the '''i4000320''' and deltaF508 mutations. Sequencing of exon 14b identified a G to A substitution at position +5 of the splice donor site. Such a mutation was predicted to lead to splicing of exon 14a to exon 15, with the deletion of a 38bp exon 14b from the mature CFTR mRNA, resulting in a frameshift mutation and likely in a truncated protein. Southern hybridization and quantitative analyses were performed to determine how abolishing this mutation is for the splicing activity, demonstrating that the patients homozygous for the 14b mutation could produce 4% of the normal CFTR mRNA compared to normal subjects. The patients homozygous for this mutation suffered from a more mild form of cystic fibrosis compared to patients that were compound heterozygous for deltaF508 and 2789+5G>A mutations. In 2008, the truncated version of the CFTR was experimentally identified, further supporting the predicted outcome of the mutation .The first thorough genotype-to-phenotype correlation analysis for '''i4000320''', after the Highsmith ''et al'' study, was published in 2005, in which 34 French patients having the 2789+5G->A/deltaF508 genotype were compared with their matched homozygous deltaF508 patients. The authors reported that the compound heterozygotes had milder disease phenotype: higher frequency of pancreatic sufficiency, better anthropometric and lung function measure, and lower infection susceptibility . In 2006, Mainz, ''et al'', described the case of the oldest living German brothers who are both compound heterozygotes for 2789+5G->A and deltaF508. This study serves as evidence for the association between this particular splicing mutation with the more mild form of cystic fibrosis and thus long term survival .In another study the authors used the database of the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Registry to examine the genotype-phenotype association by looking at the mortality rate of patients homozygous for deltaF508 and the most common compound heterozygous ones. 17853 out of 28455 patients enrolled in the registry were genotyped. Of these, 82 had the 2789+5G->A mutation. They had a significantly lower standardized mortality rate of 4.4 deaths per 1000 person-years (p-value < 0.0001) than those homozygous for deltaF508 (21.8, which was associated with the highest mortality rate .The distribution and frequencies of the CF mutations have been found to be heterogeneous among different ethnic groups. Knowing the precise distribution of the CF mutations, as well as their frequencies, is crucial for genetic counseling and genetic diagnostics. The available data up to date for the 2789+5G->A polymorphism worldwide is summarized in the following table:{| class="wikitable"|-! Population !! Year the study was published !!

    [[ID:q3065]]
    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3065">First discovered in 2004, rs34637584 is a SNP indicating a position within the LRRK2 that encodes a variant protein. This SNP is commonly referred to as the G2019S variant (or, mutation) based on the potential change from glycine (encoded by rs34637584(G) allele) to serine (encoded by the rs34637584(A) allele) at position 2019 of the LRRK2 protein.Note: as of June 2016, we have noticed that this SNP is prone to being miscalled in AncestryDNA V2.0 datasets.One copy of a rs34637584(A) allele is sufficient to greatly increase one's risk for Parkinson's disease. It is considered a disease causing mutation because it is rarely found in healthy, elderly people without Parkinson's disease, and it has been found in both familial and sporadic types of the disease. While there are many different SNPs that can influence one's risk for Parkinson's disease, rs34637584 is an especially common cause of the disease in Berber Arabs and Ashkenazi Jews. Overall, the risk of Parkinson's disease for a person who inherits a rs34637584(A) allele is 28% at age 59, 51% at 69, and 74% at 79, according to the International LRRK2 Consortium.This SNP  has been associated with disease at varying frequencies in Asian (<1%), European (1%&#8211;7%), North American (1%&#8211;3%), North African (34-41%), and Ashkenazi (10&#8211;25%) sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease patient populations .The G2019S mutation is also common not only in Parkinson's disease patients but also in controls at a frequency of 2.2% in North African Berber-Arabs (13/597, ), 1.4% in Sephardic Jews (5/361, ) and 1.3% in Ashkenazic Jews (4/317, ) while it is found at a very low frequency of 0.06% in Europeans (1/1550, ) and not found in sub-Saharan Africans.Individuals with G2019S who share the most common haplotype (mainly Europeans, Jews and North-Africans) very likely share a common ancestor estimated to have lived 1,525&#8211;1,830 years ago between the second and fifth centuries A.D. either in the Middle East  or in  North Africa . In contrast, other authors hypothesized that LRRK2 G2019S might be of Phoenician origin, rather than Arabic-Berber or Jewish, dating from the founding of ancient Carthage in 814 B.C. . G2019S has been observed on two additional background haplotypes (one in European&#8211;Americans and one in Japanese) distinct from the main one observed in Europeans, North-Africans and Jews. This suggests that G2019S has arisen independently on at least three separate occasions. According to the most extensive and thorough study by Lesage et al. in 2010, estimations indicated that the LRRK2 mutation on the main haplotype initially arose among Near-Easterners at least 4,000 years ago, much earlier than in previous estimations. Because of a founder effect, the ancestors of present-day Ashkenazi Jews may have kept the low-frequency G2019S mutation through the different diasporas, whereas Near Eastern daughter populations lost the mutation. "The mutation might then have been reintroduced by recurrent gene flow from Ashkenazi populations to other Jewish, European and North-African populations. The present-day frequency of the mutation in control populations (0.05% in Europeans, 0.5% in North-African Arabs and 1% in Ashkenazi Jews) may support this scenario"Is a carrier of at least one rs34637584(A) allele definitely going to develop Parkinson's disease if they live long enough? No. Several studies have found that overall the odds of developing the disease for G2019S carriers depends on age, family history, and ethnicity. The odds for G2019S carriers were calculated to be 15% at 60 years, 21% at 70 years, and 32% at 80 years in a study of Italian patients , whereas in a Jewish population the age-specific odds were 24% at age 80.Having a family history of Parkinson's disease in addition to carrying a rs34637584(A) allele is also associated with increased risk for the disease.Do the odds differ between carriers of one and two rs34637584(A) alleles? Apparently not; a study of North Africans - one of the few populations likely to have sufficient numbers of homozygote rs34637584(A;A) individuals to study due to the rarity of the mutation - there was no clinical difference between Parkinson's disease patients carrying one or two copies, and, 3 individuals (ranging from 42-70 years old) who were rs34637584(A;A) and yet did not have the disease were also observed.In 2019, a study concluded that compared to Parkinson patients due to other causes, G2019S-associated Parkinson patients had a ~10-fold higher chance of developing leukemia and a 2-fold higher chance of developing colon cancer, perhaps thereby meriting additional screening for those conditions. However, it was not clear if higher odds would have been seen in G2019S-carriers compared to healthy individuals not carrying the G2019S mutation.This SNP was in the news  in 2008 as one of Google's founders, Sergey Brin, announced that he and his mother (who has Parkinson's disease) both carry the G2019S SNP. Mr. Brin was 35 years old at the time of the announcement, and in his / blog, he comments that "I now have the opportunity to adjust my life to reduce those odds", which he states are "somewhere between 20% to 80% depending on the study and how you measure". Helixgene discusses this  extensively and concludes that people with G2019S have about a 25% chance of Parkinson's disease in their lifetime. This chance is greatly influenced by other factors including ethnicity and family history. BMC in LRRK2 is not fully penetrant in familial Parkinson's Disease and  commentarygs248 is relevant</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="896">also known as Q221Rrs1052576 is located on chromosome 1p36.21 in the coding region of CASP9. The CAG to CGG transition results in the allele Q221R. This SNP is associated with ADHD, general cancer risk, multiple myeloma, non-small cell lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma      .Generally the A allele confers protection from a variety of cancers. An intact apoptotic pathway is essential for many cellular processes including development, immune response and prevention of cellular transformation. Caspases are cysteinyl aspartate proteases involved in signal transduction cascades that result in programmed cell death. CASP9 is an initiator caspase and part of the intrinsic pathway, which is an evolutionarily conserved apoptotic pathway. It is responsible for cleaving and activating the executioner caspases CASP3, CASP6, CASP7, leading to nuclear membrane breakdown, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis.In their 2014 study, Lee et al performed an ADHD GWAS meta-analysis to identify casual SNPS in ADHD by focusing on SNPs in coding regions as well as a secondary analysis for pathway enrichement . They identified 11 candidate SNPS, three in the CASP9 gene, rs1052576, rs1052571, rs1820204. This GWAS was performed on a dataset that contained 428,074 SNPS from a publicly available database. This data set is derived from the IMAGE project which comprises of 924 trios of European decent, either an affected child and both parents or an affected child and one sibling and one parent. Patients in this study had to meet stringent criteria as well as live with one biological parent and one full sibling to control for environmental factors. The authors identified SNPS using two approaches. The first approach filtered SNPs by linkage disequilibrium analysis followed by a second approach to  that enriched for SNPs using pathway based analysis algorithm called i-GSEA. The authors used a p<0.05 threshold as well as an FDR cutoff of 0.1 to correct for the multiple testing conditions.  For rs1052576 p=0.042. Odds ratio could not be determined from the data provided in the manuscript. In another recent study, Yan et al performed a meta-analysis of the rs1052576 SNP in CASP-9 . Seven case-control studies with a total of 1668 cancer cases and 2294 healthy controls were analyzed. Six types of cancer were studied: gastric cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, myeloma and liver cancer. Four studies were performed in China, two in the USA and one in Russia. The &#8220;A&#8221; allele carriers of rs1052576 had overall reduced risk for cancer: the "A" allele conferred an OR=0.72( 0.58-0.89) p=0.003. However, these data were only statistically significant in Asian populations: rs1052576-A resulted in an OR=0.60 with a 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.81 and a p<0.001, in Asians irrespective of the national origin of the study. Caucasian carriers of rs1052576-A did trend towards a lower OR, however, these data did not reach statistical significance and may warrant further studies: OR=0.85(0.70-1.04), p=0.11. In 2009, Andrew et al identified SNPs to predict bladder cancer susceptibility and survival .  They performed a case-controlled study with 832 bladder cancer cases and 1,191 controls using a population of New Hampshire residents;  95% of this cohort was of Caucasian origin. SNPs that modulated bladder cancer survival were selected using an FDR threshold of <0.5. They found that the rs1052576-G allele reduced survival time for carriers with bladder cancer and increased risk of death due to bladder cancer OR=1.4 (0.8-2.4) and p=0.003. Hosgood, et al performed a population based case control study of 128 cases of women with multiple myeloma and 516 controls all from Connecticut . rs1052576-AG conferred a decreased risk of multiple myeloma OR=0.8 (0.5-1.3) p=0.41, rs1052576-AA OR=0.5 (0.3-0.9)p=0.02,  p=0.02 for the trend. These data need to be considered with care, as the rs1052576-AA odds ratio was the only value that reached near statistical significance on its own. Apoptosis is particularly important in the development of B-lymphocytes. A role for CASP9 in these B-cell lymphomas is likely to be of mechanistic importance. In 2006, Lan et al investigated the effect of SNPs in CASP3 Ex8-280C>A (rs6948) and Ex8+567T>C (rs1049216), CASP8 Ex14-271A>T (rs13113), casp9 Ex5+32G>A (rs1052576) and CASP10 Ex3-171A>G (rs3900115) in the risk of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR. rs1052576-AA genotype had an OR=0.7 (0.5-1.0) p=0.044 for all Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas.  In addition, there were protective effects for the rs1052576-A allele in B-cell lymphomas specifically: rs1052576-AA OR=0.7 (0.5-1.0) p=0.040. The protective effect of the rs1052576-A allele was not statistically significant in T cell lymphomas. This may reflect a small sample size or an inherent difference in the biology of the two cell types. Finally, B-cell lymphomas were further divided into three subtypes: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  The rs1052576-AG conferred an OR=0.6 (0.4-1.0) p=0.039 for follicular lymphoma. It is likely that the rs1052576-AA genotype is protected, however the numbers were small of this genotype and did not reach statistical significance. CASP9 is an important member of the apoptotic pathway and has clear mechanistic importance in the regulation of apoptosis. rs1052576 -G confers an increased risk of cancer in numerous studies. There does seem to be a dose dependent effect, however, this remains to be confirmed with more studies.   A allele associated with lower odds of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (OR(AA+AG) = 0.6, 95% CI, 0.4-1.0) among 996 women located in Connecticut (461 cases, 535 controls) A allele associated with lower odds of Multiple myeloma (OR(AG) = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.5-1.3; OR(AA) = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9; p-trend = 0.02) among 664 women located in Connecticut (128 cases, 516 controls)</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1278">rs4680 (Val158Met) is a well studied SNP in the COMT gene. The COMT gene codes for the COMT enzyme, which breaks down dopamine in the brain's prefrontal cortex.  The wild-type allele is a (G), coding for a valine amino acid; the (A) substitution polymorphism changes the amino acid to a methionine.  This alters the structure of the resultant enzyme such that its activity is only 25% of the wild type.  As a result, A allele carriers have more dopamine in their prefrontal cortex, which may be responsible for many of the neuropsychological associations listed below./ 23andMe blog summarizes the alleles at this SNP as rs4680(A) = Worrier. Met, more exploratory, lower COMT enzymatic activity, therefore higher dopamine levels; lower pain threshold, enhanced vulnerability to stress, yet also more efficient at processing information under most conditions rs4680(G) = Warrior. Val, less exploratory, higher COMT enzymatic activity, therefore lower dopamine levels; higher pain threshold, better stress resiliency, albeit with a modest reduction in executive cognition performance under most conditionsRoughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at ) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.Specific studies include:rs4680, a functional Val/Met polymorphism, showed modest association with Irish familial schizophrenia.

"Increased limbic and prefrontal activation elicited by unpleasant stimuli in subjects with more met158 alleles might contribute to the observed lower emotional resilience against negative mood states." In response to pain Met/Met allele carriers showed greater "sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in val158 homozygotes. The COMT val158met polymorphism thus influences the human experience of pain and may underlie interindividual differences in the adaptation and responses to pain and other stressful stimuli."

        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="450">rs10490924, also known as c.205G>T, p.Ala69Ser and A69S, was identified as a risk factor from chromosome 10 related to age related macular degeneration. The risk allele is (T). Odds ratios for heterozygotes and homozygotes are, respectively, 2.69 (CI: 2.22-3.27) and 8.21 (CI: 5.79-11.65).Disease risk in combination with the rs1061170 SNP in the CFH gene is dramatically increased. Homozygotes for both the rare/risk alleles at both loci are estimated to be at 57 fold higher risk for age related macular degeneration than individuals homozygous for the common alleles at both loci. A subsequent study indicated that the risk based on solely the ARMS2 SNP rs10490924 is significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. Based on a study of ~750 patients, rs10490924 is significantly higher in participants with choroidal neovascularization than in those with geographic atrophy (odds ratio 1.37, CI: 1.21-1.54, p = 4.2 &#215; 10(-7)).Note that this SNP is completely predictive (ie is in perfect linkage disequilibrium) with rs11200638, thus the status of one predicts the status of the other. A likely biological mechanism is that the A69S change in the LOC387715/ARMS2 protein affects its presumptive function in mitochondria. rs10490924 and rs11200638 defined 2 significant haplotypes associated with increased risk of neovascular AMD.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="279">'''WARNING!''' The orientation of this SNP was flipped from being on the FWD strand in the human genome assembly GRCh37 to being on the REV strand in assembly GRCh38; then in August 2015 an alert SNPedia user alerted us to the fact that it has somehow flipped back to being on the FWD strand in dbSNP again, whereas in 2017 and now (2018) it is back on the REV strand. This SNP is clearly prone to confusion.23andMe has a second SNP (in addition to rs1800546) assaying this position, which is identified as i5012663.rs1800546 is located on chromosome 9q31.1 within the aldolase B fructose bisphosphate ALDOB gene.  rs1800546 is linked to approximately 65% of hereditary fructosuria (also known as fructose intolerance or HFI) cases in those of European ancestry.  The incidence of HFI in those of European ancestry is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 births.  HFI is an autosomal recessive condition.  This SNP is an ambiguous flip prone to some confusion (see warning at top of page), but to be clear, in SNPedia the current orientation for the ancestral allele of this SNP is now G, while the risk-associated allele is C. Note: Reports from DNA testing labs may be not be clear which strand is being reported. Aldolase B is a critical enzyme involved in the breakdown of the sugar fructose through the glycolysis pathway.  The nucleotide change results in an amino acid substitution at position 149 from alanine to proline (A149P).==CLINICAL OVERVIEW:==Aldolase B fructose bisphosphate catalyzes the reversible reaction of fructose-1-phosphate to glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate.  Further conversion of these 3-carbon products allows the byproducts of fructose metabolism to enter into the glycolysis pathway.  Homozygous loss of function of aldolase B leads to an inability of the body to break down fructose into byproducts for human consumption.  Due to the continuation of the first step in fructose breakdown, the conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, a phosphate sink is created in these patients, in which all the available phosphate is consumed in the cell.  This leads to the halt of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.  Symptoms usually begin at the time of weaning and include: bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, mental depression, jaundice, and cirrhosis that can lead to liver failure and death.   Many patients display a food aversion to fructose-rich foods and practice strict avoidance of fructose-containing foods before their diagnosis.  The current gold standard for testing of fructose intolerance is the hydrogen breath test, in which the patient is administered fructose in the clinical setting, and hydrogen levels are measured before and at intervals after administration of the bolus of fructose.  An increase in hydrogen produced reflects the failure of the patient to absorb fructose, which is then metabolized by bacteria in the gastrointestinal system to give off hydrogen.  The disadvantage of this test is that many patients respond to the fructose administration with signs of severe hypoglycemia including altered consciousness, diaphoresis, and seizures, sometimes resulting in death.  Therefore, elucidation of the causes of HFI and available genetic testing can avert the extreme clinical risks associated with standard of care diagnosis. There is currently no cure for HFI, with the only treatment strict diet modifications to avoid fructose-containing foods.==RISK-ASSOCIATED SNP:==Numerous studies identify and characterize the deleterious nature of the A149P missense mutation, corresponding to rs1800546. In 1988, Cross, et. al first described the genetic based for HFI in four patients as a G→C transversion in the coding sequence of exon 5 at position 149, resulting in an amino acid substitution of alanine to proline in a critical substrate binding region.  PCR amplification revealed the A149P substitution in the proband and 4 members of the pedigree, showing the carrier status of the parents and one sibling, and the affected proband and another sibling,  A case study of seven unrelated Italian patients with HFI was conducted in 2004 looking at the mutational spectrum within the aldolase B gene.  The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was used to perform sequencing of patient DNA for known and novel mutations in the aldolase B gene.  The nine exons, splice junctions, and promoter region were sequenced in each patient. In contrast to American mutations, in which the two most common mutations A149P and A175D account for 85-90% of phenotypes, they account for only 65% of patients in Italians, with many more rare mutations accounting for the remainder of the genetic basis underlying HFI.  In 2005, the structures of the wild type and mutant aldolase B were published by Malay, et. al., revealing a thermolabile mutant.  The A149P mutant is reported to lose catalytic function at temperatures > 15°C, to lose tertiary structure at 33°C, and to lose its secondary structure at 45°C.  The structural constraints placed by the mutant amino acid proline disrupt the secondary structure of the β-sheet, with further reaching implications for the nearby catalytic site, including the neighboring arginine at position 148 and its interactions with Glu189 and Arg303.  The mutant structure was found to have only low levels of catalytic activity in vivo, with a T1/2 of 25°C, corresponding to almost no activity at body temperature of 37°C.  In 2008, Davit-Spraul, et. al screened the molecular basis of HFI in 160 patients from 92 families by PCR-restriction.  Patients for which mutations could not be found were further investigated using exon scanning and LR-PCR to search for novel mutations and deletions or insertions.  In 75% of patients, the three most common mutations, including A149P, were identified.  15% of patients were found to have one A149P mutation with a rare or novel compound heterozygous mutation elsewhere in the aldolase B sequence.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="3352">rs1801133 is a SNP that is relatively common and has been studied for (relatively) a long time. Also known as C677T, Ala222Val, and A222V, it encodes a variant in the MTHFR gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in folate drug metabolism|metabolism. Homozygous rs1801133(T;T) individuals have ~30% of the expected MTHFR enzyme activity, and rs1801133(C;T) heterozygotes have ~65% activity, compared to the most common genotype, rs1801133(C;C). "/ Our Take on The MTHFR Gene," is a 23andMe blog posting (January 5, 2017), a meta-analysis finding that the past two decades of scientific evidence as it relates to specific MTHFR-influenced health conditions to be inconclusive or conflicting, with two exceptions, 1. women with two copies of C677T variant, 2. a very rare variant that may cause homocystinuria. Their takeaway, "Based on the existing data, scientists at 23andMe have concluded that people should not interpret their genotypes at the common MTHFR variants as having an effect on their health."This reduced activity (i.e. this SNP) has been linked at least once to each of the following disorders (though not necessarily reproducibly):  autism  cancer, including   gastric cancer   lung cancer   head and neck cancer   renal cancer  cleft lip and cleft palate  coronary artery disease  dementia  depression  hyperhomocysteinemia  migraine  neural tube defects  pre-eclampsia (gestational hypertension)  schizophrenia  thrombosis  down syndromePubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking rs1801133 to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in  this article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. Another meta-analysis of three studies on rs1801133 stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).rs1801131 and rs1801133 have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.Based on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the rs1801133(T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).A study of 677 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for rs1801133(T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001). Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2012 May;24(4):269-81. doi: 10.1016/j.clon.2011.03.005. Epub 2011 Apr 13.  A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs1801133(T) allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~5x for heterozygous and homozygous rs1801133(T) genotypes, respectively (p=0.028). If a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele was also a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).'''Note:''' Another SNP in dbSNP, rs59514310, represents the same location as rs1801133.  rs1801133(T;T) post-menopausal women said to be at 2x higher risk for osteoporosis. Genetic impairments in folate enzymes increase dependence on dietary choline for phosphatidylcholine production at the expense of betaine synthesis. MTHFR 677C&#8594;T polymorphism is more prevalent among mothers of children with Down syndrome than among control mothers, with an odds ratio of 1.91Gene-wide association study between the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) and schizophrenia in the Japanese population, with an updated meta-analysis on currently available data.  rs1801133 shows no consistent association with schizophrenia overall in 12 studies totaling 3,000+ patients</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1838">rs6025 represents a SNP in the Factor V F5 gene, encoding a change in the protein from an arginine at position 506 to a glutamine. The resulting rs6025(A) allele encodes a mutation known as the Leiden mutation, R506Q. This mutation is often referred to as the G1691A or 1691G-A change.See the  OMIM entryIn a 2017 study using UK Biobank, based on 3290 VTE cases and 116 868 controls, the odds ratio for a polymorphism involving the minor risk allele was 3.5. They also found higher odds for venous thromboembolism in overweight individuals (+1.57 for every 1 SD higher BMI).  In a 2013 meta-analysis of 31 databases, the analysis of Factor V rs6025 variants was based on 9,081 cases and 17,513 controls. The polymorphic variant risk for Venous Thromboembolism was overall OR: 4.38. The risk was greater in younger subjects (<45 years old, OR: 5.43; ≥45 years old, OR: 3.71). Slightly higher risk appeared in men (OR: 5.06) and in women taking oral contraceptives (OR: 6.10). The AG polymorphic variant was associated with recurrent thrombosis (recurrent VTE event, OR: 5.81; no recurrence reported, OR: 3.95). The higher risks were for venous thrombosis without evidence of pulmonary embolism (OR: 4.49) or a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (OR: 4.14). The AA homozygous variant was rarer, and its risk was significantly higher at 11.45 but was based on fewer individuals (116 subjects among cases and 24 controls). Independent risk was seen in variants of the PT20210A or Factor 2 SNP at i3002432 (also known as rs1799963 ) Other studies have come to similar conclusions. In a 2004 study of over 9,000 Caucasian adults in the Danish population, rs6025(A;G) and rs6025(A;A) genotypes had 2.7x and 18x higher risk for venous thromboembolism, respectively, than rs6025(G;G) individuals. The lowest absolute 10-year risks for venous thromboembolism for (A;G) and (A;A) genotypes were 0.7% (CI: 0.5% to 1.0%) and 3% (CI: 1% to 8%) for nonsmokers younger than 40 years of age with a body mass index below 25 kg/m2, and the corresponding highest risks were 10% (CI: 7% to 14%) and 51% (CI: 13% to 100%) for overweight smokers over 60.In a study done in the year 2000 on 119 women, it was found that women who are pregnant and rs6025(A) carriers could be at risk for obstetric complications, including pre-eclampsia or venous thromboembolism, especially if they were also prothrombin rs1799963 heterozygotes and/or have a family history of thrombosis. They concluded that if you assume an overall risk rate of 1 in 1500 pregnancies, the risk of thrombosis among rs6025(A)  carriers by itself would be 0.2 percent (1 in 500); among carriers of the prothrombin rs1799963(A) by itself, would be 0.5 percent (1 in 200); and among carriers of both variant SNPs, 4.6 percent (about 1 in 20).A 2006 review article of 10 previous studies found that women who are rs6025(A) carriers also are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism and perhaps ischemic stroke when they take combined oral contraceptives (i.e. "the pill"). A 2006 literature meta-analysis from a total of 10 studies concluded that "good" evidence existed for a greater risk of venous thromboembolism (risk ratios of 1.3-25.1) and cerebral vein or cerebral sinus thrombosis when comparing heterozygotes taking such contraceptives to heterozygotes who did not. Additionally, a 2004 meta-analysis involving 18,000 cases and 58,000 controls found an increased risk for ischemic stroke for rs6025(A) carriers. The odds ratio based on a study of ~4,500 patients was 1.33, CI: 1.12-1.58.Although preliminary, a 2010 study found that women taking tamoxifen as part of their treatment for early-stage breast cancer, those who had a thromboembolic event were nearly five times more likely to have a rs6025(A) allele compared to those who did not have a TE. The authors suggest that postmenopausal women should be evaluated for the rs6025(A) SNP before being given a prescription for tamoxifen if the result would affect the decision. A related editorial pointed out that tamoxifen on its own is known to increase the risk of thromboembolic events 2-4 fold.According to a 1999 Blood journal article, coexistence of the R2 polymorphism rs1800595 with factor V Leiden increased the risk for venous thrombosis approximately to a 16-fold increased risk.  The average age of the first thrombotic event is six years younger in individuals who are heterozygous for both factor V Leiden and the R2 polymorphism than in those with factor V Leiden alone.   1999 study concluded that heterozygotes for rs6025 and rs1799963 have an increased risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis after a first episode and are therefore candidates for lifelong anticoagulation treatment.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="1312">rs231775, also known as +49A>G (or CTLA-4 A49G), is a polymorphism of the CTLA4 gene. Polymorphisms are associated with several autoimmune diseases, especially autoimmune thyroiditis, as well as several other disorders.   A 2017 study titled "CD28/CTLA-4/ICOS haplotypes confers susceptibility to Graves’ disease and modulates clinical phenotype of disease" found that rs5742909 CC and rs231775 G allele "were associated with the family burden of GD" (Graves' disease, a form of Autoimmune thyroiditis).  The G allele at rs231775 did not affect risk for Graves' Orbitopathy (GO), but favored severe disease outcome for GO. The presence of the A allele "was significantly associated with sporadic GD." A 2016 study titled "Association of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4 (CTLA4) Gene Polymorphisms with Autoimmune Thyroid Disease in Children and Adults: Case-Control Study" found that in a Han Chinese population, rs231775 "Genotype G/G conferred a risk of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.20–2.02; Pc = 0.002) for GD (Graves' disease) in adults and of 1.56 (95% CI, 1.19–2.05; Pc = 0.002) in children. Allele G was significantly associated with GD (Graves' disease) in adults (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.21–1.84; Pc < 0.001) and in children (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.15–1.77; Pc = 0.002)." A 2016 study titled "Association of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) and Thyroglobulin (TG) Genetic Variants with Autoimmune Hypothyroidism" sampled 84 hypothyroidism patients and 62 controls from Gujarat, India. Researchers found that CTLA4 Exon1 (+49A/G) rs231775 polymorphisms increased the odds of autoimmune hypothyroidism in their sample: Odds ratios were   for AA, 1.0 (Genotypes were similar between patients and controls)  for AG, 5.333 (95%CI 2.043 to 13.92, p=0.0004) compared to AA  for GG, 5.778  (95%CI 1.829 to 18.25, p=0.0004) compared to AAThey also discovered that polymorphisms of rs231775 were associated with significantly decreased mRNA expression of both full length (flCTLA4) and soluble (sCTLA4) transcripts.   AA genotypes were similar between patients and controls.  AG decreased expression of both significantly (by p = 0.0141 for flCTLA4, and by p = 0.0358 for sCTLA4) in patients compared to controls  GG decreased expression levels slightly (by p = 0.0007 for flCTLA4, and by p = 0.0102 for sCTLA4) in patients compared to controlsThey also found significant differences in patients vs. controls when analyzing the TG exon 33 SNP rs2076740. A 2014 study titled "The association of PTPN22 rs2476601 polymorphism and CTLA-4 rs231775 polymorphism with LADA  risks: a systematic review and meta-analysis" examined Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) and found that "The minor T allele at rs2476601 and the minor G at rs231775 carried estimated relative risks (odds ratio) of 1.52 (95 % CI 1.29–1.79) and 1.39 (95 % CI 1.11–1.74), respectively. These alleles contributed to an absolute lowering of the risk of all LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults) by 4.88 and 14.93 % when individuals do not carry these alleles." Researchers stated that "LADA accounts for 2–12 % of all cases of diabetes" but "The progression to insulin dependence in LADA patients is believed more rapidly than classic type 2 diabetes patients" and "8–10 % of patients diagnosed with T2D are in fact misdiagnosed LADA."  A 2015 study titled "Association between CTLA-4 rs231775 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility" revealed that "The frequencies of genotype AA and allele A in CTLA-4 rs231775 polymorphism were significantly higher in cases" of liver cancer than the control group (AA vs. GG: OR=2.81, P=0.043; A vs. G: OR=1.63, P=0.022). Meanwhile, the genetic expression level of CTLA-4 was remarkably higher in cases compared with the controls. The association analysis indicated that AA genotype carriers exhibited highest level of CTLA-4 (P<0.01)."   A 2015 study titled "Associations between CTLA-4 +49 A/G (rs231775) polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis based on 52 case-control studies" stated "This meta-analysis suggests that the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism may be a protective factor for cancer."  The minor G allele decreased cancer risk overall and for a large number of cancer types, "especially for breast cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers, epithelial tumor, respiratory system cancer, reproductive and breast cancer, malignant bone tumor," "but not digestive system cancer, hematopoietic malignancy and skin cancer." Most of the decreased cancer risk was in Asian populations. Table 3 data demonstrated "association between the risk of cancer and the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphism (GG+AG vs. AA)." Although most of the Asian data showed "decreased risk," a few studies showed extreme increased risk, and these data skewed the average OD. On average, the data showed 0.85 OD of decreased cancer risk overall (0.98 for Caucasians and 0.76 for Asians). In this 2008 article, researchers reported that "One of the best demonstrations of the power of subset analysis is the CTLA-4 gene in T1D. Although CTLA-4 showed very weak association with T1D, when analyzed in the subset of patients with both T1D and AITD, the genetic effect of CTLA-4 was significantly stronger." Note: rs231775 is one SNP within the CTLA-4 gene.. Published 2012. From abstract: "The combined results showed that there were significant differences in genotype distribution between SLE cases and control on the basis of all studies, GG versus AA (OR = 1.53, 95 % CI: 1.12-2.10), GG versus GA/AA (OR = 1.30, 95 % CI: 1.04-1.64), GG versus GA (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.55). When stratifying for the race, the phenomenon was found that SLE cases had a significantly higher frequency of GG/GA versus AA (OR = 1.58, 95 % CI: 1.23-2.03), GG versus AA (OR = 1.89, 95 % CI: 1.23-2.91), GG versus GA/AA(OR = 1.39, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.89), GA versus AA(OR = 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.06-1.80) and G versus A(OR = 1.34, 95 % CI: 1.07-1.67) than control in Asians."

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="5051">This SNP in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene, rs1800629, is also known as the TNF-308 SNP. Occasionally the rs1800629(A) allele is referred to as 308.2 or TNF2, with the more common (G) allele being 308.1 or TNF1. The (A) allele is associated with higher levels of TNF expression. This SNP has been linked to a wide variety of conditions:  Allograft rejection   Among 72 Polish patients receiving a kidney transplant, the risk of acute kidney allograft rejection was 2.5x higher among rs1800629(A) carriers compared to (G;G) homozygotes (CI: 1.19- 5.37, p<.05).   Asthma   A meta-analysis of ~2,500 patients combined indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele was associated with a 1.46x increased risk for asthma.    In a study of ~600 Mexican families and their asthmatic children, rs1800629(A) carriers had an increased risk of asthma (relative risk = 1.54, CI: 1.04-2.28), especially among children of non-smoking parents (odds then 2.06, CI: 1.19-3.55, p for interaction = 0.09).    In a study of Norwegian children, nonallergic asthma was associated with rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio 1.7, CI: 1.3-2.3).   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   A meta-analysis of 36 publications totaling ~5,000 patients concluded that the association between the rs1800629(A) allele and the risk of COPD was statistically significant for Asians (odds ratio 2.36, CI: 1.84 - 3.02, p < 0.0001) but not for Caucasians.  Crohn's disease   In a study of 235 Portuguese patients, the rs1800629(A;A) genotype was associated with higher susceptibility to Crohn's disease, with an odds ratio of 3.0 (CI: 1.2-7.2). These homozygotes also showed more disease-related complications.   Exfoliation glaucoma (XFG)   A study of 204 patients with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) concluded that rs1800629 is unlikely to be a major risk factor for XFG in Caucasians.   Graves' disease   A meta-analysis of 10 case-control studies, including over 2,200 Graves' disease cases, concluded that rs1800629(A) carriers were associated with this type of hyperthyroidism.   Heart disease   A study of 600 Italian patients concluded that rs1800629(A) carriers are at increased risk for acute heart attack and have other markers of heart disease. The odd ratio was 1.86, CI: 1.08-3.21, p=0.027).    A study of 50 Egyptian children with rheumatic heart disease found increased risk associated with the rs1800629(A;A) homozygotes, with odds ratio = 5.7, p<0.001. However, there was a significantly lower frequency of heterozygous genotypes.     However, a 2016 meta-analysis including 12 publications consisting of 6000+ cases found no significant association between rs1800629 and risk for myocardial infarction.  Ischemic stroke   A meta-analysis of 18 studies with 8075 patients found no significant association between ischemic stroke and the TNFα-308G/A, except potentially in a subgroup of East Asians.  Leprosy   A study of 37 Thai patients with leprosy found that the rs1800629(A) allele was more common (odds ratio = 2.69, p=0.04). PMID 17624216}  Liver disease   A study of 108 Chinese patients concludes that rs1800629(A) carriers are at 3.23x (CI: 1.10-9.44) increased risk for liver cancer and are also at higher risk for hepatic fibrosis and more severe liver damage.    Lymphoma   A study of 194 Tunisian patients indicated an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma among rs1800629(A;A) genotypes, at an odds ratio of 3.63, p=0.028.    A study of 441 incident non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases indicated that, compared with the wild-type rs1800629(G;G), the (A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk (odds ratio 2.14, CI: 0.94-4.85), whereas the (A;G) genotype was not. This association was similar for follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.    A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. Five SNPs in two cytokine genes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha, were associated with a 1.31x increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63; P = 0.01) and with a 1.64x increase in the subtype known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23-2.19; P = 0.0007). The other four SNPS are listed below. The cytokine genes affect inflammatory and innate immune responses.    rs361525    rs1799724    rs909253    rs2239704  Susceptibility to Mediterranean spotted fever   Although cytokine genes affect immune response to infection, in a Sicilian population the rs1800629 polymorphism did not affect susceptibility to Mediterranean spotted fever.   Migraine   Polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene may be associated with migraine and cardiovascular disease. The rs1800629 SNP has not been found significant.   Multiple sclerosis (MS)   A study of 300 Croatian and Slovenian patients indicated that rs1800629(A) carriers might be at lower risk for multiple sclerosis.   Nasal polyps   The rs1800629(A;G) genotype was associated with increased risk for nasal polyps in a study of 82 Turkish patients.     Another study found a nearly doubled risk for rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio, 1.86; confidence interval, 1.4-3.09).   Psoriasis   A study of 160 Polish patients indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele frequency was significantly decreased among patients with early-onset psoriasis (7.5% vs. 15.4%, p=0.022).    In contrast, 147 Irish patients with psoriasis were studied and the results indicated that the rs1800629(A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk as well as earlier onset of psoriasis.   Rheumatoid arthritis - response to TNF-alpha inhibitors   2009 meta-analysis of 9 studies concludes rs1800629(A) allele carriers respond less well to TNF-alpha inhibitors when being treated for rheumatoid arthritis.   Sarcoidosis   In a pooled analysis of seven case-control studies, the odds ratio for sarcoidosis for carriers of the rs1800629(A) allele was either 1.47 (CI 1.03-2.08 under a dominant model) or 1.39 (CI: 0.67-2.90; under a recessive model).   Susceptibility to sepsis   A study of 159 patients with severe trauma indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele was associated with higher risk of developing sepsis and of dying (odds ratio 7.65, two-sided p = 1.9 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). The authors of this research suggest that preemptive anti-inflammatory interventions should be developed for use in carriers of this SNP should they suffer severe injuries.    A meta-analysis of 25 studies concluded that while rs1800629 status is significantly associated with risk for sepsis, especially among Asians, it was not associated with mortality from sepsis. However, there may be an increased risk for fatal outcomes among Asians (odds ratio 10.75, CI: 3-39, p < 0.01).  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)   A study of 120 Columbian patients with SLE found an increased risk for rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio 3.9, CI: 1.65-5.80, p= 0.0004).    A meta-analysis of 21 studies indicated that in European populations, the rs1800629(A) allele is associated with increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In Europeans, the oodds ratio for the (A;A) genotype was 4.0, CI: 2.5-6.4, p<0.001. No association was detected in Asian-derived populations. The overall odds ratio for rs1800629(A) carriers was 2.0 (CI: 1.3-3.1, p<0.001).</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="4247">This important SNP, located in the PTPN22 gene and also known as R620W, C1858T, or 1858C>T, may influence risk for multiple autoimmune diseases, such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Type-1 diabetes, Autoimmune thyroiditis, and Systemic lupus erythematosus.==Overview==. A 2014 article explained that "PTPN22 exemplifies a shared autoimmunity gene, affecting the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis and other autoimmune diseases." They explored "the role of PTPN22 in autoimmune connective tissue disease" and theorized "a number of PTPN22-dependent functional models of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases." (Abstract). They explained that "the PTPN22 gene is a major risk factor for autoimmunity." As well, "In addition to autoimmune diseases, PTPN22 1858C>T also affects susceptibility to infectious diseases." A 2005 study titled "Analysis of families in the multiple autoimmune disease genetics consortium (MADGC) collection: the PTPN22 620W allele associates with multiple autoimmune phenotypes" stated "We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2476601, encoding R620W) in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) confers risk of four separate autoimmune phenotypes in these families: T1D, RA, SLE, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. MS did not show association with the PTPN22 risk allele. These findings suggest a common underlying etiologic pathway for some, but not all, autoimmune disorders, and they suggest that MS may have a pathogenesis that is distinct from RA, SLE, and T1D." (Abstract).NOTE Promethease reports for rs2476601 from Trait-o-matic are consistently finding this called as (A;G), while microarray results seem to follow the HapMap predictions. The source of this originates upstream in several different genotype callers: maq SoapSNP AB_SOLiD_SNP_caller JW NA18507 SIQ2 CV GSNAPThis is probably triggered by the oddness of this dbSNP entry in which it is a C=>T in NM_012411.2 and a T=>C in NM_015967.3 and/or the fact NT_019273.18 was replaced by NT_032977 ==Rheumatoid arthritis== A 2007 study titled "Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls" examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls in the British population. They found that in the case of rs2476601, the risk was consistent with previous estimates for RA, approximately OD 1.8, and that "known associations with HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22 explain around 50% of the familial aggregation of RA." They found a correlated marker for RA, rs6679677. In addition, SNP rs11761231 had no effect on risk in males, but in females had an "additive OR for females 1.32"  A 2005 study titled "PTPN22 genetic variation: evidence for multiple variants associated with rheumatoid arthritis" found that R620W rs2476601 polymorphism was the most significant SNP in sample set of 37 SNPs. They also found these significant ORs for RA (estimated for the minor allele of each SNP; Table 1):  rs2476601 1.65 (p=6.6E-04)  rs974404 1.49 (p=2.4E-05)  rs2476600 1.49 (p=2.5E-05)  rs2797416 1.49 (p=2.2E-05)  rs1310182 1.48 (p=3.2E-05)  rs2476604 1.48 (p=2.7E-05)  rs1217420 1.48 (p=2.7E-05) (same)  rs1217406 1.47 (p=4.6E-05)  rs12730735 0.65 (reduced risk) (p=2.0E-05)  rs3789609 0.65 (reduced risk) (p=2.7E-05)   rs12760457 0.65 (reduced risk) (p=2.0E-05)However, they found that "R620W by itself does not account for all the association observed between RA and PTPN22 in both sample sets." Further analysis revealed that two of the SNPs were important in relation to rs2476601, namely their SNP "number 27" (rs1310182) and "number 37" (rs3789604, which had OR 1.39 (p=0.0071). It showed that the R620W polymorphism was moderated by other SNPs, one increasing its OR, the other decreasing it..   In combination, the minor allele of rs3789604 gave an increased OR of 2.53 to minor allele homozygotes and 1.77 to heterozygotes of rs2476601  In combination, the minor allele of rs1310182 gave a decreased OR of 1.63 to minor allele homozygotes and 1.34 to heterozygotes of rs2476601 No association of PTPN22 gene polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Turkey. A 2005 study titled "The PTPN22 R620W polymorphism associates with RF positive rheumatoid arthritis in a dose-dependent manner but not with HLA-SE status" stated two copies of the PTPN22 R620W allele more than doubled the risk for RF positive RA A 2005 study titled "Association between the PTPN22 gene and rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis in a UK population: further support that PTPN22 is an autoimmunity gene" found that "There was a significant association between the PTPN22 SNP and RA (P = 1.8 x 10(-8)) and JIA (P = 0.0005). In contrast, no association with psoriasis, PsA, or MS was detected." (Abstract).  A 2006 study titled "Effects of PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism on susceptibility and clinical characteristics of British Caucasian rheumatoid arthritis patients"  confirms the association of rs2476601 rheumatoid arthritisThis SNP rs2476601 was confirmed in a 2007 study to be a risk factor for RA ==Juvenile idiopathic arthritis== A 2005 study titled "Association between the PTPN22 gene and rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis in a UK population: further support that PTPN22 is an autoimmunity gene" found that "There was a significant association between the PTPN22 SNP and RA (P = 1.8 x 10(-8)) and JIA (P = 0.0005). In contrast, no association with psoriasis, PsA, or MS was detected." (Abstract). ==Type 1 Diabetes== A 2006 study was titled "Systematic search for single nucleotide polymorphisms in a lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase gene (PTPN22): association between a promoter polymorphism and type 1 diabetes in Asian populations".

In a 2007 study of >6,000 controls and 6,000 patients, the heterozygote odds ratio for type-1 diabetes for this SNP was recalculated to be 1.98 (CI 1.82-2.15).  Confirms association of rs2476601 with type-1 diabetes in a Sardinian population of 490 sporadic patients (794 families). rs2476601(A) has a higher relative risk in type-1 diabetes cases carrying lower risk HLA class II genotypes than in those carrying higher risk ones (p=1.36x10<sup>-4</sup> in a test of interaction).==Lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; SLE)== A 2005 study titled "The R620W C/T polymorphism of the gene PTPN22 is associated with SLE independently of the association of PDCD1"  in addition to SLE results also  "found evidence of a genetic association between PTPN22 and renal disorder" (Abstract) Women with (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes displayed a 2x increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (95% CI=1.324 - 3.070, P=0.0014)==Systemic sclerosis== Meta-analysis across 12 studies, totaling 4,300+ patients, concludes that there is an association between the rs2476601(A) allele and risk for systemic sclerosis, with an odds ratio of 1.169 (CI: 1.05 - 1.3, p = 0.004). associations of rs2476601 in PTPN22 R620W single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with systemic sclerosis (SSc) or with anticentromere antibody (ACA)-positive or anti-topoisomerase I (anti-topo I) antibody-positive SSc, in a case-control study of US white, black, Hispanic, and Choctaw Indian individuals. rs2476601(A) allele is associated with (slightly) increased risk for systemic sclerosis in European Caucasians.==Vasculitis, arteritis====Autoimmune thyroiditis== rs2476601 is not associated with Graves' disease in a study of Japanese patients.==Crohn's disease, Ulcerative colitis, and Inflammatory bowel disease== A 2005 study was titled "The functional genetic variation in the PTPN22 gene has a negligible effect on the susceptibility to develop inflammatory bowel disease."==Other diseases== studied ~300 UK patients with Behcet's disease and found that the R620W allele (i.e. rs2476601(A)) appeared to provide protection from Behcet's disease.

    <blockquote>
        <p class="text-snippet" data-id="2782">rs1800795 is a SNP in the promoter of the interleukin-6 IL6 gene, affecting the levels made of this important cytokine. In the literature, it is almost universally referred to as the IL6 "-174" polymorphism. It tends to be quite polymorphic in Caucasians, but Asian and African populations are almost monomorphic (for the (G) allele).It was first described in 1998, when it was shown that the rs1800795(C) allele produces less IL6 than the (G) allele, which supported the hypothesis that a protective genotype against systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis would be rs1800795(C;C), and indeed, few juvenile RA patients had that genotype.Studies on rs1800795 now include potential associations with heart disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, type-2 diabetes, stroke, obesity, Hodgkin's lymphoma, sudden infant death syndrome, cancer (including breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer), hypertension, periodontitis, and complications arising after organ transplantations or grafts. It is worth noting that some of the associations seen for rs1800795 alleles are not for the risk of developing a given disorder; instead, they relate to how a disorder might progress or respond to various treatments. Summaries of several major associations are available at  OMIM.The rs1800795(G) allele, generally associated with higher levels of IL6, has been associated with increased risk in the following studies:  The rs1800795(G) allele was significantly associated with type-2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.51, CI: 1.11-2.07, p=0.0096) in a study of 700 elderly Caucasians.  Following a kidney transplant, patients with rs1800795(G;G) genotypes have a higher risk of new-onset diabetes and higher C-reactive protein levels) compared to the (C;C) genotype. Since this was more pronounced in overweight patients, the authors suggest that diabetes-inducing drug administration should be limited in overweight patients who are rs1800795(G;G) following renal transplantation.  The development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after lung transplantation is more likely and happens earlier for rs1800795(G) carriers.  Among HIV+ men, the lifetime risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma is higher for rs1800795(G;G) homozygotes compared to (C;C) homozygotes.  Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma who are rs1800795(G;G) were less likely to be successfully treated, with odds ratios for failure of 1.75 (CI: 1.04-2.92, p=0.03).  A study of 139 elderly males with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) indicated that rs1800795(G;G) genotypes were at 3.89 fold (CI: 1.71-8.86, p=0.001) higher risk of dying within one year of their ACS event than (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes.  Although the odds of having a stroke weren't different, among patients (in this case, under 60 years of age) who did have a stroke those with a rs1800795(G;G) genotype had more severe disability after 1 week (odds ratio 3.2, CI: 1.5-6.6, p=0.002).  Among Chinese patients with hypertension, the rs1800795(G) allele is more common, and (G;G) genotypes had significantly higher plasma PAI-1 activity than (C;C) genotypes.  In 168 Brazilian patients, rs1800795(G) allele frequency was higher in gastric cancer than in patients with chronic gastritis.   Although the odds of having Crohn's disease aren't affected, among 153 children with it, those with the rs1800795(G;G) genotype were more growth-retarded at diagnosis than (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes. (G;G) patients also had higher circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP).   rs1800795(G) carriers don't increase their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels after 24 weeks of aerobic exercise as much as rs1800795(C) carriers.  The rs1800795(G;G) genotype was more frequent in Australian infants with sudden infant death syndrome (58%) than in control subjects (38%, p=0.02). This was not seen in a Norwegian population.  Women with endometriosis who are rs1800795(G) carriers appear to be more likely to develop chocolate cysts, and (G) allele carriers may be at slightly higher risk of developing endometriosis.  The rs1800795(G) allele is more frequent in women with hyperandrogenism than in controls.  Children with the rs1800795(G;G) genotype are more likely to have recurrent acute otitis, based on a study of 348 patients, with an odds ratio of 1.64 (p=0.02).   (G) allele is increased risk ((C) allele is decreased risk) for type-2 diabetes; this SNP is one of 4 relatively common SNPs reported to represent risk for type-2 diabetes in the DESIR prospective study of 3,877 Caucasian participants. Under an additive model, the odds ratio for rs1800795(C) carriers is 0.79 (CI: 0.65-0.96, p=0.01). For the 4 SNPs, each risk allele increased type-2 diabetes risk by 1.34x (p=2x10e-6), with an odds ratio of 2.48 (CI: 1.59-3.86) for carriers of 4 or more compared to those with one or none (risk alleles).The rs1800795(C) allele, generally associated with lower levels of IL6, has been associated with increased risk in these studies:  rs1800795 (C;C) and (C;G) Caucasians who are excessively heavy (body mass index ~33 +/- 5kg/m2) are at increased risk (odds ratio 5.2, p=0.003) for developing obesity-related metabolic disorders such as hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.  Among 571 patients with type-2 diabetes, the rs1800795(C) allele is correlated with higher body mass index, but it showed no correlation among non-diabetics.  A study of 238 Caucasians with type-2 diabetes concluded that rs1800795(C) carriers have an insulin resistance "IL-6-sensitive" phenotype and perhaps strategies to manage insulin resistance should be different between (C) carriers vs. (G;G) patients.  In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) being treated by hemodialysis, rs1800795(C) allele carriers had higher diastolic blood pressure (p=0.008) and a higher left ventricular mass index (p=0.026) than (G;G) homozygotes. Among diabetic patients in dialysis, the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in (C) allele carriers was 87.5% vs. 36.3% among (G;G) genotypes (p= 0.02).  Among recipient of a kidney transplant, rs1800795(C) allele carriers had worse three-year graft survival (71/104 = 68.3%; p=0.0059) with a 3.7-fold increased relative risk of graft loss compared to rs1800795(G;G) genotypes (48/54 = 88.9%). The authors suggest that determining the rs1800795 genotype may offer a new method for identifying patients at increased risk of allograft loss.  Among prostate cancer patients, the rs1800795(C) allele is associated with more aggressive cancer and higher prostate-specific antigen levels compared to rs1800795(G;G) homozygotes.  Although the rs1800795(C) allele was not associated with a higher frequency of heart attacks, it did have an association with inflammation and infarcts detectable only by MRI, suggesting that rs1800795(C) may chronically predispose an individual to develop atherosclerosis.  The combination of carrying at least one rs1800795(C) and one rs1205(T), a SNP in the C-reactive protein gene, led to higher risk of a stroke after cardiac surgery (odds ratio 3.3, CI: 1.4-8.1, p=0.0023) compared to individuals who were rs1800795(G;G) and rs1205(C;C).  The rs1800795(C) allele was associated with higher postoperative IL6 levels and a less favorable clinical outcome following coronary revascularization surgery.  The rs1800795(C;C) genotype was significantly higher in the group of 122 adult periodontitis patients than in controls (odds ratio 1.896, CI: 1.1-3.2, p=0.0283).  The degree of periodontitis was more severe in rs1800795(C) carriers than (G) carriers.  The rs1800795(C) allele was over-represented in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls and the (C;C) genotype was associated with higher risk in women.  The rs1800795(C) allele was higher in non-survivors compared to (nonagenarian) survivors in a case/control study of ~100 pairs of matched Finnish individuals; to put it another way, the rs1800795(G) allele may be associated with increased longevity. rs1800797, rs1800796 and rs1800795 have been shown to affect both the transcription and secretion of IL-6, to symptomatic distal interphalangeal osteoarthritis based on 535 women. the G alleles of two promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) G-597A and G-174C were more common among the subjects with symptomatic DIP OA than among those with no disease (p-values corrected for multiple testing 0.020 and 0.024). Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001). Carriage of the G-G diplotype indicated an increased risk of both symmetrical DIP OA (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28) and symptomatic DIP OA (OR 3.67 95% CI 1.50 to 9.00) Suggests that "healthy elderly individuals may have a proinflammatory profile playing as a downregulating factor for inducible Hsp70, particularly if -174 G/C-negative" and that therefore, a nutraceutical intervention (fermented papaya preparation 9 g/day) might be of benefit. rs1800795 coronary artery disease 190 affected Asian Indian sibling pairs</p>
