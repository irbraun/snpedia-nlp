The orientation of this SNP was flipped from being on the FWD strand in the human genome assembly GRCh37 to being on the REV strand in assembly GRCh38; then in August 2015 an alert SNPedia user alerted us to the fact that it has somehow flipped back to being on the FWD strand in dbSNP again, whereas in 2017 and now (2018) it is back on the REV strand. This SNP is clearly prone to confusion.23andMe has a second SNP (in addition to rs1800546) assaying this position, which is identified as i5012663.rs1800546 is located on chromosome 9q31.1 within the aldolase B fructose bisphosphate ALDOB gene.  rs1800546 is linked to approximately 65% of hereditary fructosuria (also known as fructose intolerance or HFI) cases in those of European ancestry.  The incidence of HFI in those of European ancestry is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 births.  HFI is an autosomal recessive condition.  This SNP is an ambiguous flip prone to some confusion (see warning at top of page), but to be clear, in SNPedia the current orientation for the ancestral allele of this SNP is now G, while the risk-associated allele is C. Note: Reports from DNA testing labs may be not be clear which strand is being reported. Aldolase B is a critical enzyme involved in the breakdown of the sugar fructose through the glycolysis pathway.  The nucleotide change results in an amino acid substitution at position 149 from alanine to proline (A149P).==CLINICAL OVERVIEW:==Aldolase B fructose bisphosphate catalyzes the reversible reaction of fructose-1-phosphate to glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate.  Further conversion of these 3-carbon products allows the byproducts of fructose metabolism to enter into the glycolysis pathway.  Homozygous loss of function of aldolase B leads to an inability of the body to break down fructose into byproducts for human consumption.  Due to the continuation of the first step in fructose breakdown, the conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, a phosphate sink is created in these patients, in which all the available phosphate is consumed in the cell.  This leads to the halt of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.  Symptoms usually begin at the time of weaning and include: bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, mental depression, jaundice, and cirrhosis that can lead to liver failure and death.   Many patients display a food aversion to fructose-rich foods and practice strict avoidance of fructose-containing foods before their diagnosis.  The current gold standard for testing of fructose intolerance is the hydrogen breath test, in which the patient is administered fructose in the clinical setting, and hydrogen levels are measured before and at intervals after administration of the bolus of fructose.  An increase in hydrogen produced reflects the failure of the patient to absorb fructose, which is then metabolized by bacteria in the gastrointestinal system to give off hydrogen.  The disadvantage of this test is that many patients respond to the fructose administration with signs of severe hypoglycemia including altered consciousness, diaphoresis, and seizures, sometimes resulting in death.  Therefore, elucidation of the causes of HFI and available genetic testing can avert the extreme clinical risks associated with standard of care diagnosis. There is currently no cure for HFI, with the only treatment strict diet modifications to avoid fructose-containing foods.==RISK-ASSOCIATED SNP:==Numerous studies identify and characterize the deleterious nature of the A149P missense mutation, corresponding to rs1800546. In 1988, Cross, et. al first described the genetic based for HFI in four patients as a G→C transversion in the coding sequence of exon 5 at position 149, resulting in an amino acid substitution of alanine to proline in a critical substrate binding region.  PCR amplification revealed the A149P substitution in the proband and 4 members of the pedigree, showing the carrier status of the parents and one sibling, and the affected proband and another sibling,  A case study of seven unrelated Italian patients with HFI was conducted in 2004 looking at the mutational spectrum within the aldolase B gene.  The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was used to perform sequencing of patient DNA for known and novel mutations in the aldolase B gene.  The nine exons, splice junctions, and promoter region were sequenced in each patient. In contrast to American mutations, in which the two most common mutations A149P and A175D account for 85-90% of phenotypes, they account for only 65% of patients in Italians, with many more rare mutations accounting for the remainder of the genetic basis underlying HFI.  In 2005, the structures of the wild type and mutant aldolase B were published by Malay, et. al., revealing a thermolabile mutant.  The A149P mutant is reported to lose catalytic function at temperatures > 15°C, to lose tertiary structure at 33°C, and to lose its secondary structure at 45°C.  The structural constraints placed by the mutant amino acid proline disrupt the secondary structure of the β-sheet, with further reaching implications for the nearby catalytic site, including the neighboring arginine at position 148 and its interactions with Glu189 and Arg303.  The mutant structure was found to have only low levels of catalytic activity in vivo, with a T1/2 of 25°C, corresponding to almost no activity at body temperature of 37°C.  In 2008, Davit-Spraul, et. al screened the molecular basis of HFI in 160 patients from 92 families by PCR-restriction.  Patients for which mutations could not be found were further investigated using exon scanning and LR-PCR to search for novel mutations and deletions or insertions.  In 75% of patients, the three most common mutations, including A149P, were identified.  15% of patients were found to have one A149P mutation with a rare or novel compound heterozygous mutation elsewhere in the aldolase B sequence.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in populations with European ancestry:  the average carrier frequency is 1:25. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). The CFTR gene encodes a chloride transporter, gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. It regulates the transport of chloride and other ions across the cell membrane. Mutations in CFTR result in raised sweat chloride, respiratory infections, and pancreatic insufficiency.To date, 1939 mutations in the CFTR gene that cause cystic fibrosis have been curated in the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database. Different combinations of mutations in the gene have different effects on its function and thus cause different disease phenotypes. The most common mutation is deltaF508, which is present in about 70% of the cystic fibrosis patients. '''i4000320''', also known as 2789+5G>A and as rs80224560 to the rest of the world (outside of 23andMe), is a rare mutation in the CFTR gene located at position 117242922 of chromosome 7 that causes a mild form of cystic fibrosis . The risk allele is '''i4000320''' (A). Because cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive inherited disease, one needs to carry two defective copies of the CFTR gene to develop the disease. Most commonly, patients harboring the 2789+5G>A variant will be compound heterozygotes carrying other CFTR mutations.Highsmith ''et al'' first identified the '''i4000320''' SNP in 1997  in a study of eight CF patients in a single inbred family. Three of them were homozygous for the '''i4000320''' mutation, and the rest were compound heterozygotes, harboring both the '''i4000320''' and deltaF508 mutations. Sequencing of exon 14b identified a G to A substitution at position +5 of the splice donor site. Such a mutation was predicted to lead to splicing of exon 14a to exon 15, with the deletion of a 38bp exon 14b from the mature CFTR mRNA, resulting in a frameshift mutation and likely in a truncated protein. Southern hybridization and quantitative analyses were performed to determine how abolishing this mutation is for the splicing activity, demonstrating that the patients homozygous for the 14b mutation could produce 4% of the normal CFTR mRNA compared to normal subjects. The patients homozygous for this mutation suffered from a more mild form of cystic fibrosis compared to patients that were compound heterozygous for deltaF508 and 2789+5G>A mutations. In 2008, the truncated version of the CFTR was experimentally identified, further supporting the predicted outcome of the mutation .The first thorough genotype-to-phenotype correlation analysis for '''i4000320''', after the Highsmith ''et al'' study, was published in 2005, in which 34 French patients having the 2789+5G->A/deltaF508 genotype were compared with their matched homozygous deltaF508 patients. The authors reported that the compound heterozygotes had milder disease phenotype: higher frequency of pancreatic sufficiency, better anthropometric and lung function measure, and lower infection susceptibility . In 2006, Mainz, ''et al'', described the case of the oldest living German brothers who are both compound heterozygotes for 2789+5G->A and deltaF508. This study serves as evidence for the association between this particular splicing mutation with the more mild form of cystic fibrosis and thus long term survival .In another study the authors used the database of the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Registry to examine the genotype-phenotype association by looking at the mortality rate of patients homozygous for deltaF508 and the most common compound heterozygous ones. 17853 out of 28455 patients enrolled in the registry were genotyped. Of these, 82 had the 2789+5G->A mutation. They had a significantly lower standardized mortality rate of 4.4 deaths per 1000 person-years (p-value < 0.0001) than those homozygous for deltaF508 (21.8, which was associated with the highest mortality rate .The distribution and frequencies of the CF mutations have been found to be heterogeneous among different ethnic groups. Knowing the precise distribution of the CF mutations, as well as their frequencies, is crucial for genetic counseling and genetic diagnostics. The available data up to date for the 2789+5G->A polymorphism worldwide is summarized in the following table:{| class=""wikitable""|-! Population !! Year the study was published !!

The primary endpoint was either fatal heart disease or a heart attack.The blood pressure after six months of rs5065(G;G) patients (note: genotype is in dbSNP orientation, not as published) was lower if the patients were treated with diuretics compared to other medications, with smaller variation seen for (A;A) genotypes. The authors noted that none of the findings retained statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons, but since the trend held in five of seven outcomes, they felt the results were nonetheless worth reporting. In summary, rs5065(G) allele carriers were better off (i.e. experienced more favorable cardiovascular disease outcomes) if treated with the diuretic (in this case, chlorthalidone), whereas rs5065(A;A) carriers were better off if treated with the calcium channel blocker (in this case, amlodipine). rs5067 is a SNP in the natriuretic peptide precursor A NPPA gene.In a study of ~500 asthma patients, rs5067(G) were at reduced (50% or 76%) risk; the odds ratio in the first and second populations were 0.5 (CI: 0.29-0.84, p=0.009) and 0.24 (CI: 0.11-0.53, p<0.0001), respectively.

hsa,RNASEL,"rs3738579 represents a SNP in the 5' UTR region upstream of the RNASEL gene. A study of patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the uterine cervix, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), and breast cancer found 1.5x-2x increased risk for all three cancer types for the rs3738579(T;T) genotype, while finding decreased risk (0.5x) for rs3738579(C;T) heterozygotes. rs3738579(C;C) homozygotes had 0.6x less risk for cervical cancer but increased risk for HNSCC (1.4x) and breast cancer (1.8x). Although statistics were not reported per genotype, a combination of data from all three cancer forms over all genotypes provided strong statistical evidence for rs3738579 as a cancer marker, with a p-value of 4.43x10(-5).Note that the research cited above was published over a decade ago, and there has been no follow-up or replication to our knowledge. It would be best to consider the research preliminary and perhaps of little to no clinical significance (until it is confirmed or replicated in a larger sample). rs486907 is a SNP in the RNase L RNASEL gene that has been associated with cancer risk. The basic rationale behind most of these studies is that RNase L is responsible for deactivating RNA-based viruses that are associated with certain cancers, and therefore SNPs that lead to lower RNase L activity may lead to increased cancer risk. This SNP is also known as R462Q or Arg462Gln.In a study of prostate cancer patients, rs486907(A;G) heterozygotes were calculated to be at 1.5x increased risk, and rs486907(A;A) homozygotes 2x risk (p=0.007).This SNP was also associated with hereditary-prostate-cancer (HPC) predisposition with an odds ratio of 1.97 (p=0.07) in a study of 116 affected Finnish families.See also:  rs627839 is a SNP that tags the RNASEL gene actually located within the hereditary prostate cancer 1 HPC1 gene.This SNP is one of five SNPs reported to be useful in a SNP set defining the risk of dying from prostate cancer among patients with the disease; see gs242 and gs243.",,,SNPedia

Genetics and pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia. Identification of the Arg1086His mutation in the alpha subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel (CACNA1S) in a North American family with malignant hyperthermia. '''rs2281845''' is a SNP located on chromosome 1q32.1, about 250 bp upstream of the first exon of the CACNA1S (voltage-dependent calcium channel, L type)gene. The linkage disequilibrium block containing rs2281845 extends 22 kb downstream and includes the TMEM9 gene (transmembrane protein 9). This SNP has been clinically  associated with tooth development. The minor allele (T) has specifically been associated with reduced mature dentition between the ages of 6 and 14 in women. In a 2011 report, a genome-wide quantitative trait association study conducted with 521,741 SNPs over 5,097 women from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) found a significant (p-value=1.31E-10) association between the rs2281845 T allele and a reduction in permanent teeth erupted (-0.105) between ages 6 and 14. To confirm this finding, an additional 3,696 individuals were also tested for this association. These subjects were drawn from three additional Danish cohorts, as well as one from the United States. The association was replicated in each of the Danish cohorts (p-values=5.43E-05, 1.09E-04, and 0.012, respectively), but the group from the United States exhibited a weak association (p-value=0.242) in the opposite direction (+0.065 teeth). This contradictory finding was attributed to small sample size and deficiencies in phenotype reporting. The original GWAS and replication datasets, when combined for a total of 8,793 subjects, showed a statistically significant (p-value=8.03E-17) negative association with number of permanent teeth (-0.103). Within the same study, three additional SNPs were identified in the initial DNBC cohort GWAS as having a significant association with number of permanent teeth between ages 6 and 14. These SNPs &#8211; rs12424086, rs4491709, rs7924176 &#8211; were each validated to statistical significance with a replication set (p-values=2.30E-12, 2.16E-14, and 5.64E-19, respectively). No loci aside from those containing these four SNPs exhibited a p-value of less than 5.0E-6. Each of these SNPs that were identified in the context of dental development may be confounded by associations with generalized maturation programs. The authors note that while the phenotype of mature teeth was measured here, the SNPs could in fact correlate better with measures of puberty such as &#8220;skeletal maturation, Tanner score and growth spurt,&#8221; with number of mature teeth simply as a manifestation of these other phenotypes. Mechanistically, rs2281845&#8217;s effect on tooth development may be linked to expression of TMEM9. In a study linking SNPs to gene expression in monocytes, several variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs2281845 were found to be significantly associated with TMEM9 expression. The SNP with highest linkage to rs2281845, rs6667912 (r2=0.42) showed a significant association (p-value=6x10E-29). Little is known regarding the function of TMEM9.

This SNP, located in the first intron of the RET gene, has been associated with Hirschsprung disease. The risk allele (in dbSNP orientation) is rs2435357(A), with greater affect in males.    the C allele of rs2505535 would appear to represent a protecting allele for the Chinese population  Identifying candidate Hirschsprung disease-associated RET variants. Variants in RET associated with Hirschsprung's disease affect binding of transcription factors and gene expression. rs2506030 is a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in gene RET. Its ancestral/non-risk allele is A and derived allele G. RET (ret proto-oncogene) is a cadherin family member and encodes a receptor tyrosine kinases. Functionally, it is involved in neural crest development. It’s located on the plus strand at 10q11.2 of the human genome spanning over 50K bp. There are 21 exons in the gene and 2 isoforms. Other than Hirschsprung disease, mutations in this gene is also associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia And Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) or congenital aganglionosis is a developmental defect characterized by the absence of neuronal ganglia in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Patients can be classified into 3 sub categories based on the length of the colon: short segment, long segment, or total colonic aganglionosis (TCA). The incidence is roughly 15/100,000 in population of European descent and twice as high for Asians. HSCR is a non-Mendelian disease. Mutations in a few genes have been identified to be associated with HSCR: RET, GDNF, NRTN, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, ZEB2, PHOX2B, KIAA1279, TCF4, and L1CAM.rs2506030 was first identified by Charkravarti’s group in a family-based GWAS study published in 2015. A total of 220 European American trios with short-segment HSCR were recruited and their DNA genotyped using Affymetrix platform, resulting in 500,000 SNPs. Association was tested using case pseudo-control and rs2506030 is statistically significantly different in the two groups (p value 2.78*10^-15). Furthermore, the statistical significance was confirmed in a replication study of 429 more HSCR trios of all segment lengths (p value 2.02*10^-4, combined p value 4.44*10-15, odds ratio = 2.0). Note that rs2506030 is independent of another common RET SNP rs2435357, which is common in HSCR patients based on previous studies. They hypothesize that rs2506030 affects a RET enhancer. Another study by the same group further studied rs2506030 in HSCR patients. This study includes a population case control comparison as well as family based association testing. Comparing the allele frequencies in cases and controls, there was a significant difference between allele frequencies in rs2506030  (p value 4.7*10^-10). Similarly, there is significant statistical evidence (p value = 5.3*10^9) of higher frequency of risk allele homozygotes in cases. OR was estimated to be 1.8. In addition, TDT was performed in 254 trios and 72 duos and the risk allele is over transmitted to probands (p = 9.5*10^-6).

The frequency of the rs5051(T) allele is also generally higher in African populations compared to Caucasian populations, correlating to the higher incidence of hypertension in African population.rs5051 is also known as ""A-6G""; the ""A"" allele when referred to using this nomenclature is rs5051(T), and the ""G"" allele is rs5051(C). For more details, see rs699.rs5051(T;T) homozygotes have been reported to be at increased risk for Crohn's disease, as based on one cohort of ~350 Australian patients.

hsa,ADCY2,"rs13166360 at 5p15.31 is located in an exon of adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2) and encodes a missense mutation (valine&#8594;leucine) in a transmembrane domain of the protein. A GWAS has associated '''rs13166360''' with bipolar disorder in people of European ancestry. == '''Clinical Background''' ==Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a severe mood disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and mania. BD has a lifetime prevalence of 1% in the general population (4% in the United States), and therefore can be classified as a common condition. To date, there does not exist any clear associations between race or socioeconomic status, and the onset of BD. Bipolar Disorders are amongst the 10 highest burden diseases, as ranked by the World Health Organization. In particular, those suffering from bipolar disorder are at a higher risk of suicide, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse . For further information about bipolar disorder, wikipedia offers a great article: .== '''SNP Data''' ==A GWAS by Muhleisen and coworkers links '''rs13166360''' to Bipolar Disorder. The authors were motivated by the success of a previous GWAS for bipolar disorder  that had not implicated the ADCY2 gene, and added additional subjects (2,266) and controls (5,028) in order to increase the power of this study. This data primarily comes from the MooDS (Systematic Investigation of the Molecular Causes of Major Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia) consortium. The new data unique to the Muhleisen et al study, which helped to find '''rs13166360''', was primarily genotyped on the Illumina Infinium assay. In all, the combined datasets analyzed ~2.3 million SNPs from 9,747 cases and 14,278 controls that are of European Ancestry, but who currently live in Europe, Australia and the USA. This represents the largest BD GWAS to date. The datasets were merged according to a standardized genomic control &#955;-factor (1.018) in order to control for p-value inflation. The meta-analysis found 56 SNPs that passed genome-wide significance at 5 distinct genetic loci. Of these 5 loci, 3 had been previously described (ANK3, ODZ4, and TRANK1), while two were completely novel (ADCY2 and the region between MIR2113 and POU3F2)'''Rs13166360''' was found as a proxy to another novel SNP (rs17836816) in the ADCY2 gene (r2=0.95), and presented genome-wide significance (p-value 1.81x10-8 with an allelic odds ratio of 1.14). Neither had previously been described in the context of Bipolar Disorder, and ADCY2 SNPs had not previously been associated with BD. '''Rs13166360''' describes a deviation from the major allele G to T (minor allele) that encodes a Valine to Leucine missense codon in ADCY2.== '''Relation to Disease''' ==There is consensus amongst the scientific and medical community that Bipolar Disorder is a multifactorial disease, with both genetic and environmental causes. ADCY2 is an integral membrane protein that, upon activation by heterotrimertic G proteins, catalyzes formation of the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that then activates protein kinase A (PKA) pathways. Many neurotransmitters function through G protein-coupled receptors, that in turn signal through these heterotrimeric G proteins. GPCRs represent a large pool of candidate genes for neuropsychiatric disorders, and accordingly, many antipsychotics target multiple receptors at once. Since ADCY2 is a signal integrator that acts downstream of many of these signaling pathways, any altercation to its function would occur downstream of multiple receptors and neurotransmitter pathways. It is not currently known if the V147L mutation is deleterious to the protein. While multiple adenylate cyclase genes exist, ADCY2 is uniquely expressed in the brain.",,,SNPedia

Carriers of two such alleles have lower vitamin D than carriers of one allele, who in turn on average have lower vitamin D levels than rs10741657(A;A) individuals.

The variant has been strongly associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia. is evidence to suggest that ApoE-ε3ch may be associated with strong resistance to developing Alzheimer's disease. A 2019 study  reported that that a carrier of a pathogenic PSEN1 mutation, known to cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease, who was also a homozygous ApoE3ch carrier, did not show cognitive symptoms before her seventies, almost three decades after expected onset. Autosomal dominant forms of Alzheimer's disease and sporadic Alzheimer's disease show largely similar pathogenesis. Likewise, common APOE alleles(ApoE-ε2, ApoE-ε3, and ApoE-ε4) have similar effects in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (, ApoE-ε4 carriers have earlier onset, ApoE-ε2 alleles have later onset). Together, this these findings suggest that being a homozygous ApoE-ε3ch carrier will potentially also convey protection against sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, assuming that ApoE-ε3ch follows an allele-dose risk pattern similar to what has been observed for common APOE alleles , heterozygous ApoE-ε3ch carriage may also be convey protection against sporadic Alzheimer's disease. rs121918394 represents a variant in the APOE gene on chromosome 19. There are two known alternative alleles, known as c.490A>C, p.Lys164Gln or K164Q, or as c.490A>G, p.Lys164Glu or K164E, using current reference numbering. However, in older publications, this position is historically described as being amino acid '''146''' (not 164), and so p.Lys146Gln and p.Lys146Glu can also be found as aliases in the literature.The K164E/K146E variant has been designated ApoE1-Harrisburg according to  OMIM, and is a dominant mutation leading to familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. This variant is called i6007512 by 23andMe.The K164Q/K146Q variant is also a dominant mutation leading with high penetrance to type III hyperlipoproteinemia (i.e. familial dysbetalipoproteinemia), according to  OMIM, but it is reportedly observed (electrophoretically) as an E2 phenotype.Note that the first ApoE1 allele described derives from rs267606664, a variant at a different amino acid, known as c.434G>A, p.Gly145Asp or G145D, or in older numbering, p.Gly127Asp or G127D.         rs1799724, a SNP near the tumor necrosis factor TNF gene, was found in a study of ~500 Caucasians to be both an independent risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease and also a modifier of the risk for individuals carrying ApoE4 alleles. On its own, the rs1799724(T) allele led to an odds ratio of 1.63 (CI: 1.13-2.34, p=0.009). In carriers of ApoE4 alleles, the odds ratio changed from 2.92 (CI: 2.00-4.27) in the absence of rs1799724(T) to an OR of 6.65 (CI: 3.26-13.55, p=0.03) in its presence.  Note, however, that this study is from 2005 and it does not appear to have been independently replicated since then (which is why the magnitude is 2, i.e. pretty low on the 0-10 magnitude scale).In a Chinese study , post-menopausal women were significantly more likely to have low bone mineral density if they had *CC-AA genotypes in rs1799724-rs1800629* a haplotype of rs1799724-rs1800629-rs6254-rs6256-IL-1ra-rs2227956-rs1801197 news cigarette smoking and gastric cancer risk  The minor allele of rs199768005 (A)(p.V236E, T/C sic) is a rare mutation (0.12%) in the APOE gene. It is one of only two protein APOE variants with MAF>0.1% in the Exome Variant Server (EVS,  study found that carriers of this rare mutation had a markedly reduced risk for AD (OR=0.10, 0.03-0.45). Only 2 of 25 heterozygotes had AD versus 23 controls (4128 LOAD, and 4986 controls). The minor allele of rs199768005 is in phase with the APOE epsilon 3 allele. p.V236E divides the epsilon 3 haplotype into epsilon 3b (the minor allele of rs199768005) and epsilon 3a (major allele of rs199768005). The risk of AD among those with epsilon 3b genotype was substantially reduced(OR=0.11,0.02-0.36, P=2.32x10-3). This decrease in AD risk was AD independent of the epsilon 2, 3 and 4 alleles. If confirmed, this rare genotype might reduce risk of AD more than the well-known epsilon 2 genotype.Within the context of AD, the minor allele of rs199768005 appears to reduce disease risk. However, it is cited on this page and dbsnp as pathogenic in the context of Familial type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia.   Conflicting reports of possible small increase in Alzheimer's risk. Currently dubious at best.rs2373115 is one of several SNPs in the GAB2 gene indicating an increased risk (OR 4.1) of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, but apparently only in individuals also carrying ApoE4 alleles, i.e. rs429358(C) alleles  rs2373115 marker does not modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Spanish APOE e4 carriers.rs2373115(G) is the risk allele. (p = 9 x 10(-11)) was associated with an odds ratio of 4.06 (confidence interval 2.81-14.69)However, a separate study of 1,749 Alzheimer patients concluded that this GAB2 SNP is ""at best a minor genetic determinant"" since the authors of this study observed only a slight tendency for an increase of the (G;G) genotype (odds ratio of 1.3 vs (G;T) and (T;T), CI:1.0-1.6, p=0.09) and for an increase in the G allele frequency (odds ratio 1.3, CI:1.0-1.6, p=0.05) in ApoE4-carriers.   A new (Dec 2008) meta-analysis concludes that, yes, indeed, rs2373115 is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease among ApoE4 carriers, with an odds ratio of 1.58 (CI: 1.17 - 2.14, p = 3 x 10e-3), but only among carriers. This meta-analysis pooled published studies with a new study of 443 AD cases. A study of 579 Italian Alzheimer's patients saw this association, but only in ApoE4 non-carriers, suggesting it might be an independent risk factor for the disease.    rs267606664 represents a variant in the APOE gene on chromosome 19. Based on electrophoretic mobility differences, this variant gave rise to a protein termed the ApoE-1 variant.This variant is also as c.434G>A, p.Gly145Asp or G145D, or in older numbering, p.Gly127Asp or G127D, and while reported in 1984 in a Finnish hypertriglyceridemia patient,  OMIM reports that the association with that disorder was unclear.The 23andMe name for this variant is i6007510. The ancestral allele is A.    rs387906567, also known as c.478C>T, Arg160Cys and R160C, is a SNP in the APOE gene on chromosome 19. The less common allele, rs387906567(T),  is normally found in a haplotype consisting of it and rs429358(C), the less common allele for that APOE SNP as well.Together, this haplotype is reported to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, leading to familial hyperlipoproteinemia, type III.. Subsequent studies have implicated the Arg160Cys change in this haplotype as being responsible for the defective lipoprotein binding associated with that condition.See also: OMIM  107741.0008In 23andMe data, rs387906567 is referred to as i5000217 and i6007504.      obstructive sleep apnea rs405509 Significant Alzheimer's disease associations with were found for rs449647(A;A) and rs405509(G;G) genotypes (positive), and rs449647(A;T) and rs405509(T;T)<p>Note: the 2016 paper discussing a potential algorithm for Alzheimer's risk based on ApoE promoter polymorphisms, , is considered too preliminary (and based on too few patients) to add to SNPedia in any detail. This SNP, located in the fourth exon of the ApoE gene, affects the amino acid at position 130 of the resulting protein. The more common rs429358 allele is (T). If the allele is (C) and the same chromosome also harbors the rs7412(C) allele, the combination is known as an APOE-ε4 allele. The APOE-ε4 allele has a strong influence on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Many studies have estimated the level of risk, and it varies depending on age, sex, ethnicity, and other factors. One meta-analysis estimated the odds ratios for homozygous rs429358(C;C) individuals compared to the more common ApoE3/ApoE3 homozygotes to be 12x for late-onset Alzheimer's and 61x for early-onset disease. Meta-analyses have also supported the association between the APOE-ε4 allele and somewhat increased risk for heart disease, with an odds ratio of 1.42 (CI: 1.26 - 1.61).Note: Although ApoE status is technically defined by these two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412, a SNP in the adjacent ApoC1 gene, rs4420638, is co-inherited with ApoE and thus often - though not completely - predictive of it.  This appears to be the snp on the Illumina Human 550 which is closest to rs4420638 rs440446 is a SNP in an intron of the apolipoprotein E APOE gene; it is also known as the IVS1+69 variant.In a study of ~1,000 Chinese patients with various biliary tract conditions, including cancer and gallstones, men carrying a rs440446(C) allele (in dbSNP orientation) had a 1.7x risk of gallstone disease CI: 1.2-2.4, a 1.8x risk of gallbladder cancer (CI: 1.0-3.3), a 3.7x risk of bile duct cancer (CI: 2.0-7.0), and a 4x risk of ampullary cancer (CI: 1.4-12.4).Note: orientation relative to dbSNP entry is reversed as published.

The APOE -219G/T and +113G/C polymorphisms affect insulin resistance among Turks. Apolipoprotein E ApoE status is technically defined by two different SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412.  This SNP, rs4420638, is situated about 14kb away in the adjacent ApoC1 gene and is co-inherited with ApoE and thus associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.rs4420638 (the proxy SNP) is not independent of rs429358. These two SNPs are correlated with each other and it's believed that most of the association with AD at rs4420638 is due to its proximity to rs429358. That said, rs4420638 is not a perfect proxy for rs429358 either -- rs4420638 correlates better for certain genotypes and for certain ethnicities. For example, if you have the genotype at rs4420638 that is more correlated with the e4 allele of APOE, you still only have a 50% chance of actually having the e4 allele. And rs4420638 is not very predictive for any genotype in African populations. The (G;G) form of this SNP indicates increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, however the probability and amount of increased risk is subject to some disagreement. The initial report concerning this SNP indicated a high likelihood that rs4420638(G;G) homozygotes were predictably ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes and thus at significantly (15 fold or higher) risk for Alzheimer's. However, one testing service has estimated pers. communication that 25% to 50% of people with the (G;G) are *not* actually ApoE4 homozygotes, and are more likely to be at ~2-3x increased risk based on being ApoE3/ApoE4 heterozygotes. If you were tested on deCODEme or 23andMe v3 platform, ignore this proxy and just check your status at rs429358 and rs7412. 23andme added rs429358 for people who tested on the v3 platform on 04/14/2011, so you should re-download your data if you haven't.This  AlzForum.org article suggests that ApoE4/ApoE4 homozygotes have a ~15-fold increased risk for developing the disease compared to ApoE3/ApoE3 carriers, whereas rs4420638(A;G) individuals have a ~3-fold increased risk.ApoE4 status is notable as being the variation that several well known scientists, including Nobel Prize winner User:Watson|James Watson, request not to learn when having their own genomes analyzed.Meta-analyses have also supported the association between the ApoE4 allele and somewhat increased risk for heart disease, with an odds ratio of 1.42 (CI: 1.26 - 1.61)./ 23andMe blog each rs4420638(G) lowered CRP by 21.8% also associated with higher total cholesterol, LDL choelsterol and triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterolNote: the :Category:On_chip_Affy500k|Affymetrix 500K chip is said to poorly tag (ie assay) this particular SNP.

He did have extremely high cholesterol levels (760 mg/dL) and mild atherosclerosis but otherwise no significant symptoms of cardiovascular disease. Overall, it appears as if apoE is not essential in the brain or eye. The ancestral allele is C.

In particular, rs1799963 is often studied together with rs6025.In a 2013 meta-analysis of 31 databases, the analysis of i3002432 / rs1799963 (PT20210A or prothrombin or Factor 2) was based on 9,134 cases and 17,606 controls. The AG variant average risk for Venous Thromboembolism was 2.8, and risk was higher for younger subjects ((< 45 years old, OR: 3.19; ≥ 45 years old, OR: 2.57) and for women taking oral contraceptives (women not using OCs, OR: 2.73; women using OCs, OR: 5.58). Further analysis by outcome revealed that more the risk for Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was highest at 4.4 (based on 303 cases and 2,723 controls), whereas for Venous thromboembolism OR was 3.0, and for Venous thrombosis (w/o pulmonary embolism) OR 2.6. The AA variant risk was 6.74, but the odds ratio for homozygotes was based on only 28 subjects among cases and 4 controls. A larger risk was seen in rs6025 Factor V Leiden SNP variants. For a more complete discussion, see rs6025., In addition to the literature associating the G20210A variant with thromboembolism in general, several studies have found that this variant significantly (2 - 20 fold) increases the risk for ischemic stroke (aka cerebral ischemia) in individuals with patent foramen ovale (PFO), or hole in the heart.

Gaucher's disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to deficient activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase, and over 200 mutations have been described in the GBA gene, many of which lead to Gaucher Type I or Type II disease.The mutation encoded by rs104886460 is one of the top 5 or so Gaucher-related variations found in Ashkenazi Jews, and is known as ""IVS2+1G-A"". It is most commonly associated with Gaucher Type I disease but has also been seen associated with Type II disease, apparently depending on the nature of the ""other"" GBA mutation found in an individual (since it's a recessive condition requiring both alleles to be affected).See also: OMIM  606463.0015   rs1064651, also known as Asp448His or D448H, is a SNP in exon 9 of the GBA gene on chromosome 1. As the protein was originally numbered, though, this variation occurred at amino acid 409 (rather than 448), so the scientific literature still often refers to this mutation as Asp409His or D409H.Mutations in both copies of a person's GBA gene may lead to Gaucher's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder. When one of the mutations is the D409H mutation, the clinical description may be Gaucher disease type 3C, involving valvular heart disease. However, the clinical presentation appears to be highly variable as well as dependent on which two mutations are present. For more information, see OMIM  606463.0006.Be aware that since this mutation is due to a G>C (tranversion) when oriented in the direction the gene is transcribed, interpretation can be problematic due to  orientation issues involving  ambiguous flips.                       rs2230288, also known as E326K or E365K, is a variation in the GBA gene which appears to be well tolerated; in other words, it is not associated with Gaucher disease.However, there is some evidence suggesting it is not a neutral polymorphism; instead, it appears to be a ""modifier"" variant.A / news item from 2016 links rs2230288 to increased risk for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which often precedes synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease. Note that this research is not published as yet. Note: this SNP has been retired and replaced by rs421016, representing the exact same nucleotide position yet on the other strand, possibly with more specific flanking sequence. rs364897, also known as c.680A>G, Asn188Ser or N188S, is a variant in the GBA gene which has been associated with Gaucher's Disease.rs364897(G;G) has been observed in Korean and Taiwanese subjects with type I Gaucher disease.It may be a relatively mild defect in the gene, since the encoded enzyme appears to retain most of its function.    rs387906315, also known as c.84dupG, p.Leu29Alafs*18 or 84GG, is a causal mutation for Gaucher's disease.23andMe chooses to use their own name, i4000417, for this SNP.            rs421016, also known as L444P or Leu444Pro, is a SNP causing an amino acid change in the GBA gene; it is among the most common mutations associated with Gaucher disease of any type.  Amino acid predictions from genome sequence may predict this as L483P or Leu483Pro; this disparity in position calling may be due to a 39 peptide signal sequence. Polyphen 2 predicts  P04062 L483P to be ""possibly damaging"" with a score of 0.857 (sensitivity: 0.83; specificity: 0.93). ( P04062 is the uniprot ID for GBA.)The risk allele (in current dbSNP orientation) is (G), and as the inheritance is autosomal recessive, individuals must either be compound heterozygotes (for two different GBA mutations) or rs421016(G;G) homozygotes to develop Gaucher disease. There are over 300 mutations now known to occur in the GBA gene, with many associated with increasing risk for either type I, II, or III Gaucher disease.This SNP (along with others associated with Gaucher disease) is studied extensively in Ashkenazi Jewish populations where it is found in relatively high frequency.Note: this SNP used to have a ""mirror"" SNP, rs35095275, representing the opposite strand yet the same exact nucleotide position; it has now been merged into this SNP.One copy of rs421016(G) has also been shown to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease ~5 fold across multiple ethnicities, and to lower a bit the age of onset of Parkinson's. In one study, the estimated age-specific risk for Parkinson's disease at 60 and 80 years of age was 4.7% and 9.1% among Gaucher disease patients, i.e. those carrying two Gaucher GBA mutations, compared with 1.5% and 7.7% among GBA mutation heterozygotes, and 0.7% and 2.1% for carriers of zero Gaucher GBA mutations, respectively.

At this locus, the minor allele, T, protects against RA. The SNP is located on chromosome 20q13 in the second intron of the CD40 gene, which encodes a receptor that is expressed on the surface of multiple immune cells. CD40 binds the ligand CD154 which is expressed by activated T cells, and this interaction plays a critical role in T cell helper activity in the immune system. rs4810495 is closely linked with another SNP, rs1883832, that appears to lesson translation of the CD40 gene, affecting this critical signaling pathway that leads to B cell proliferation . Mouse model knockouts of CD40 have been shown to alleviate arthritis . The association between rs4810485 and RA was first identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis and two subsequent replication studies in patients with European ancestry .

Jointly, the meta-analysis and replication studies showed an association with a p-value of 8.2x10-9 surpassing a conservative level of significance for joint analysis and an odds ratio of 0.87, suggesting that the minor allele T gives a modest protective effect against RA.The association with RA was confirmed in a targeted validation study in the United Kingdom with 3,962 cases and 3,531 control patients . This study found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2x10-4 and an odds ratio of 0.86. Since this was a targeted study looking at 4 specific loci, the p-value is significant. Again, the odds ratio suggests a modest protective affect for the minor allele T.An additional study looked at this SNP and its association with RA in individuals of Korean ancestry . This study found no association between rs4810485 and RA in patients with Korean ancestry. The targeted validation study looked at 5 SNPs associated with RA in Europeans in 1,113 Korean cases and 988 controls, and found a p-value of 0.39 and an odds ratio of 1.06, suggesting no association between the SNP and RA in Koreans.

hsa,MSH3,"rs70991108 is a polymorphism consisting of a 19-bp deletion in the first intron of the dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene. The wild-type (non-deletion) allele is a bit more common than the deletion allele in most populations. Several studies have linked this SNP to alterations in folic acid (and folate) metabolism. A study of 1,215 subjects  from the Framingham Offspring Study concluded that rs70991108 influences the prevalence of circulating folic acid levels. Specifically, folic acid intake over 500ug/d led to high circulating (unmetabolized) folic acid levels in subjects homozygous for the deletion genotype. When folic acid intake was under 250ug/d, the deletion/deletion homozygotes had lower RBC folate (732.2 nmol/L) compared with the non-deletion genotype (844.4 nmol/L). A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs70991108 deletion allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~4.6x for heterozygous and homozygous rs70991108 deletion genotypes, respectively (p=0.05). If a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele was also a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).Studies have also looked for connections between this SNP and the risk of having a baby born with spina bifida, but the results are inconsistent between studies:* PMID 14735580, PMID 15755837: suggested the del/del genotype increased risk for spina bifida and pre-term delivery* : suggested that the del/del genotype actually reduced risk for spina bifida* : found no connection whatsoever between the del/del genotype and spina bifida risk  colorectal cancer survival rs863221, located in MSH3 (HR: 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.82, p-value: 0.001)",,,SNPedia

Rs273990 is located on chromosome 4q22 in the synuclein-alpha SNCA locus. The function of SNCA is not fully understood, but it predominately found in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, and it is thought that it plays a role in maintaining adequate supplies of synaptic vesicles.  SNCA is also a major component of Lewy Bodies (LB), protein accumulations often found in neurons in patients with PD.The best evidence for the association of rs2736990 with PD was provided in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that found an increased frequency of the minor C allele (T is the major allele) in position 90897564 among cases compared to controls.   The study first identified this SNP in a pool of 1,713 cases and 3,978 controls of European ancestry.  The researchers then successfully replicated this significant finding in a separate group of 3,361 cases and 4,573 controls, also of European ancestry.   Estimates of effect size and statistical significance from the pooled dataset (which incorporates both groups) are as follows: OR = 1.23, p = 2.24 x 10-17 .   Several other studies have also examined the relationship between rs2736990 and PD. A group of Japanese researchers conducting a GWAS on 2,011 cases and 18,381 controls of Japanese descent found a significant association of rs2736990 with PD that survived Bonferroni correction (p-value not reported) .  Another group looked at only the rs2736990 SNP in 515 cases and 450 controls of Chinese descent and found the minor C allele was significantly more frequent in patients with PD (OR=1.26, p = 0.017).  Other studies have validated the association between rs2736990 and PD in European populations:  The Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center tested rs2736990 only in 344 cases and 275 controls and found a significant association (OR = 1.40, p = 0.0032); another group combined data from previous GWAS studies with their own data to create a GWAS dataset of 1752 cases and 1745 controls that yielded a significant association (OR = 1.29, p = 6.7 x 10-8) ; finally, a GWAS conducted on 772 cases and 2024 controls of Dutch descent found a significant association between rs2736990 and PD (OR = 1.325, p = 1.63 x 10-5). It is not known with certainty how mutations in synuclein-alpha contribute to PD; however, mutations in this gene, both missense and copy number variants, have been linked to the development of PD. In addition, rs2736990 is one of several SNP&#8217;s in the SNCA locus significantly associated with PD in GWAS studies, and the significant association of this SNP with PD has been replicated and validated in several subsequent studies.  Moreover, estimates of effect size are similar across studies.  As such, the biological plausibility of this mutation appears high.  One candidate mechanism for development of PD due to SNCA hypothesizes that misfolded or excessively produced synuclein-alpha proteins accumulate in the neuron and interfere with normal function until they eventually cause death. This theory is supported by the abundance of synuclein-alpha proteins in LB&#8217;s found in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.  However, it is unclear if these LB&#8217;s are a response to injury or themselves the cause of death. Linkage disequilibrium patterns and tagSNP transferability among European populations.

The rare minor allele of this variant is reported to be pathogenic/likely pathogenic for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), according to .             rs3729547, is a SNP that was recently shown to be mildly associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  in the Han Chinese population and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Indian population.  . This SNP is located within  the coding sequence of the TNNT2 gene, which encodes a component of the troponin complex critical for proper sarcomeric contractility in cardiomyocytes, the cell type driving contraction in the heart. A number of earlier studies have shown that mutations in TNNT2 can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.    characterized by a thinning of the ventricular wall, or conversely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by a thickening of the ventricular wall. Both conditions lead to an overall weakening of the heart muscle and can lead to heart failure or sudden cardiac death.  The molecular mechanisms whereby mutations in the same gene (TNNT2) can lead to two diseases (DCM and HCM) with such contrasting phenotypes are still not well-understood. In a study by Li et al, rs3729547 (C to T) and another tagging SNP also in TNNT2, rs3729843 (G to A),  were shown to be associated with DCM in a cohort of Han Chinese individuals (X2= 6.63, P = 0.036; X2 = 9.787, P = 0.008, respectively) The risk allele for rs3729547 is T and the risk allele for rs3729843 is A. rs3729547 is a synonymous (isoleucine) variant whereas rs3729843 is a noncoding SNP. In this study, the authors investigated the association between 10 tagging SNPs (these two included) and DCM using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). However, the patients from this study were all members of the Han Chinese population, and therefore, these SNPs must be studied in the context of another ethnic group to validate strong associations between these SNPs and DCM. Additionally, this study was limited by its sample size, as only 97 DCM patients and 189 healthy unrelated controls partook in this study. In a second study published by Rani et al, the TNNT2 gene was sequenced in 162 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and in 179 healthy controls. HCM phenotype ranged from moderate to severe, but a limited number of corrective operations were performed in these HCM patients. In contrast to the Li et al paper, this study was conducted exclusively in patients from India. Fifteen associated variants were uncovered, including rs3729547 (C to T) and rs3729843 (G to A), which were found to be in high linkage disequilibrium in the HCM patients. They also identified a 5bp deletion polymorphism in this Indian population that was previously shown to be associated with HCM patients of French, Spanish, and Japanese origin.

Rs11892031A on chromosome 2q37 in an intronic region of the UGT1A locus is associated with urinary bladder cancer risk.               UGT1A1*28 duplication allele inserts a seventh (TA) pair to six (TA) pairs this reducing the activity to 30% of normal.See the following SNPs, which have been merged to rs3064744 on dbSNP:rs34815109rs35600288  Although the insertion is supposed to be the minor allele, the majority of FTDNA v2 and 23andMe v2 results show II as the result, so use caution when interpreting this result.rs34815109 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers. These risks include:* An increased risk for breast cancer is reported in premenopausal African-American women, based on a study of 200 women. The reported odds ratio was 1.8 (CI: 1.0-3.1, p=0.06) for carriers of one or more UGT1A1*28 alleles.* In colorectal cancer patients being treated with irinotecan, adverse side effects (neutropenia and/or severe diarrhea) are reported to be strongly associated with the number of UGT1A1*28 alleles. Patients homozygous for the *28 allele are 3.5 times more likely to develop severe neutropenia compared with individuals with the wild genotype. The FDA has approved a genetic test for UGT1A1 status to be used to determine dosage when considering irinotecan therapy  FDA press release. However, no prospective study has examined whether a reduced dose of irinotecan results in a reduced rate of adverse drug events.* Hyperbilirubinemia, a potentially toxic increase in bilirubin levels, is possible among rs34815109(TA;TA) individuals treated with the drug tranilast.The three other SNPs that describe the same polymorphism are:* rs34983651* rs35600288* rs5839491  rs34983651 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene; the primary entry in SNPedia for this set of SNPs is at rs34815109.

The minor rs2229169 allele was in a strict linkage disequilibrium with the deletion of three amino acids in ADRA2B (Ins/Del301-303) in a mixed African–American/white group  and in a large Chinese study .Alpha-2B adrenergic receptors contribute to norepinephrine stimulation in the brain and to peripheral vasoconstriction. The deletion polymorphism del301–303 encodes a version of the receptor that, unlike normal alpha-2B receptors, fails to decrease its activity (desensitize) in response to prolonged stimulation . This may result in both negative cardiovascular consequences and positive cognitive effects.A large population cohort of Finnish middle-aged men (1606 men, mean age at the start 53 years) was followed for the average time of 18 years. Acute coronary events defined as hospitalizations for myocardial infarction or prolonged acute chest pain were more frequent in the men with del301–303 polymorphism: Del/Del OR=1.57 (P=0.002), Del/Ins OR=1.25 (P=0.077), Ins/Ins OR=1. Associations with the number of sudden cardiac deaths and overall cardiac heart disease mortality were also observed, but they would not be significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. A study of Koreans compared more than 600 patients hospitalized for an ischemic stroke with control subjects. The deletion polymorphism conferred higher risk of ischemic stroke: Del/Del OR=1.78 (P=0.007), Del/Ins OR=1.25 (P=0.107), Ins/Ins OR=1. Association of the deletion genotype with small-vessel disease was the main contributor to the risk. In a study of more than 400 young Swiss adults, the carriers of del301–303 polymorphism had about 20% better memory for emotional photographs, both positive and negative. This enhancement of emotional memory was selective: the level of emotions caused by the photographs, the memory for neutral photographs, working memory, and attention were not dependent on genotype. Among the Rwandan genocide refugees, the same authors found the deletion to be associated with increased re-experiencing of traumatic events but independently from PTSD, which was distributed equally among the genotypes.

Risk for drug dependence (and drug abuse was associated with rs324420(A;A) homozygotes. In a study of 40 daily marijuana users who abstained for 24 h and were then presented with a cue-elicited craving paradigm, followed by smoking a marijuana cigarette, rs324420(A) was significantly associated with changes in withdrawal after abstinence and with happiness after smoking marijuana, but was not associated with changes in heart rate after smoking or with changes in craving or other acute effects.This variant has also been associated with pain insensitivity. In a 2016 study, ~1000 women undergoing surgery for breast cancer were tested for cold and heat pain sensitivity; rs324420(A;A) individuals reported significantly lower cold pain sensitivity and less need for postoperative analgesia. The rs324420(A;C) genotype was also seen in a woman with unusually high pain tolerance, along with a ~8kb heterozygous microdeletion of the adjacent FAAH pseudogene.And from a different perspective, a 2016 study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies found ""a strong correlation between a nation's happiness and the presence of the (rs324420) A allele in the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) gene"".

hsa,CASP9,"also known as Q221Rrs1052576 is located on chromosome 1p36.21 in the coding region of CASP9. The CAG to CGG transition results in the allele Q221R. This SNP is associated with ADHD, general cancer risk, multiple myeloma, non-small cell lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma      .Generally the A allele confers protection from a variety of cancers. An intact apoptotic pathway is essential for many cellular processes including development, immune response and prevention of cellular transformation. Caspases are cysteinyl aspartate proteases involved in signal transduction cascades that result in programmed cell death. CASP9 is an initiator caspase and part of the intrinsic pathway, which is an evolutionarily conserved apoptotic pathway. It is responsible for cleaving and activating the executioner caspases CASP3, CASP6, CASP7, leading to nuclear membrane breakdown, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis.In their 2014 study, Lee et al performed an ADHD GWAS meta-analysis to identify casual SNPS in ADHD by focusing on SNPs in coding regions as well as a secondary analysis for pathway enrichement . They identified 11 candidate SNPS, three in the CASP9 gene, rs1052576, rs1052571, rs1820204. This GWAS was performed on a dataset that contained 428,074 SNPS from a publicly available database. This data set is derived from the IMAGE project which comprises of 924 trios of European decent, either an affected child and both parents or an affected child and one sibling and one parent. Patients in this study had to meet stringent criteria as well as live with one biological parent and one full sibling to control for environmental factors. The authors identified SNPS using two approaches. The first approach filtered SNPs by linkage disequilibrium analysis followed by a second approach to  that enriched for SNPs using pathway based analysis algorithm called i-GSEA. The authors used a p<0.05 threshold as well as an FDR cutoff of 0.1 to correct for the multiple testing conditions.  For rs1052576 p=0.042. Odds ratio could not be determined from the data provided in the manuscript. In another recent study, Yan et al performed a meta-analysis of the rs1052576 SNP in CASP-9 . Seven case-control studies with a total of 1668 cancer cases and 2294 healthy controls were analyzed. Six types of cancer were studied: gastric cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, myeloma and liver cancer. Four studies were performed in China, two in the USA and one in Russia. The &#8220;A&#8221; allele carriers of rs1052576 had overall reduced risk for cancer: the ""A"" allele conferred an OR=0.72( 0.58-0.89) p=0.003. However, these data were only statistically significant in Asian populations: rs1052576-A resulted in an OR=0.60 with a 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.81 and a p<0.001, in Asians irrespective of the national origin of the study. Caucasian carriers of rs1052576-A did trend towards a lower OR, however, these data did not reach statistical significance and may warrant further studies: OR=0.85(0.70-1.04), p=0.11. In 2009, Andrew et al identified SNPs to predict bladder cancer susceptibility and survival .  They performed a case-controlled study with 832 bladder cancer cases and 1,191 controls using a population of New Hampshire residents;  95% of this cohort was of Caucasian origin. SNPs that modulated bladder cancer survival were selected using an FDR threshold of <0.5. They found that the rs1052576-G allele reduced survival time for carriers with bladder cancer and increased risk of death due to bladder cancer OR=1.4 (0.8-2.4) and p=0.003. Hosgood, et al performed a population based case control study of 128 cases of women with multiple myeloma and 516 controls all from Connecticut . rs1052576-AG conferred a decreased risk of multiple myeloma OR=0.8 (0.5-1.3) p=0.41, rs1052576-AA OR=0.5 (0.3-0.9)p=0.02,  p=0.02 for the trend. These data need to be considered with care, as the rs1052576-AA odds ratio was the only value that reached near statistical significance on its own. Apoptosis is particularly important in the development of B-lymphocytes. A role for CASP9 in these B-cell lymphomas is likely to be of mechanistic importance. In 2006, Lan et al investigated the effect of SNPs in CASP3 Ex8-280C>A (rs6948) and Ex8+567T>C (rs1049216), CASP8 Ex14-271A>T (rs13113), casp9 Ex5+32G>A (rs1052576) and CASP10 Ex3-171A>G (rs3900115) in the risk of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR. rs1052576-AA genotype had an OR=0.7 (0.5-1.0) p=0.044 for all Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphomas.  In addition, there were protective effects for the rs1052576-A allele in B-cell lymphomas specifically: rs1052576-AA OR=0.7 (0.5-1.0) p=0.040. The protective effect of the rs1052576-A allele was not statistically significant in T cell lymphomas. This may reflect a small sample size or an inherent difference in the biology of the two cell types. Finally, B-cell lymphomas were further divided into three subtypes: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  The rs1052576-AG conferred an OR=0.6 (0.4-1.0) p=0.039 for follicular lymphoma. It is likely that the rs1052576-AA genotype is protected, however the numbers were small of this genotype and did not reach statistical significance. CASP9 is an important member of the apoptotic pathway and has clear mechanistic importance in the regulation of apoptosis. rs1052576 -G confers an increased risk of cancer in numerous studies. There does seem to be a dose dependent effect, however, this remains to be confirmed with more studies.

Authors cited a 2005 study () that ""demonstrated the presence of TSHR mRNA in human osteoblast cell lines.""  A 2011 article ""Genetics of thyroid function and disease"" reviewed past research. Genome-wide association studies have not shown SNPs in TSHR such as rs1991517 to be associated with TSH concentrations at a high level of significance, but together with two other SNPs in other genes, (PDE8B rs4704397 and  CAPZB rs10917469, the three SNPs may account for ""4.5% of the variation in TSH concentrations."" TSHR gene SNPs have not been associated with T3 and T4 thyroid hormone levels, while deiodinase genes such as DIO1 rs2235544 have been associated with them. The authors also cited articles claiming that the often-studied TSHR polymorphism of rs1991517 was relevant to bone density and insulin resistance.      (Published 2008) Researchers noted that reduced fT3/fT4 ratios may be significant, since various bodily tissues and organs differ in their level of dependence on fT3 and fT4. They analyzed 18 SNPs of DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3 and measured thyroid hormone levels in 552 people on L-T4 hormone replacement therapy, and three healthy control groups not on L-T4 therapy (totalling 2513 people). Analysis was adjusted for age and sex. * Among patients, the _minor_ allele of rs11206244 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio from 0.193 in Common homozygous to 0.175 in Minor homozygous (-0.18) p for trend = 0.004). * Among patients, the _major_ allele of rs2235544 was associated with reduced fT3:fT4 ratio (from 0.196 in Minor homozygous to 0.177 in Common homozygous (-.019), p for trend = 0.01). * The two SNPs rs2235544 and rs11206244, were in linkage disequilibrium (LD)  (r2 = 0.41), and rs2235544 was driving the association. * Polymorphisms of rs2235544 in both cases and controls achieved genome-wide significance for effect on fT3/fT4 ratio(p=3.6x10-13) in the general population, each minor allele increasing the ratio by 0.2SD.* Polymorphism did not affect TSH levels. * None of the SNPs in the other deiodinase genes DIO2 DIO3 influenced T3, T4 or TSH serum levels. * Reverse T3 (rT3) levels were not studied.* Regardless of the polymorphism of rs2235544, the fT3:fT4 ratio and fT3 levels were consistently and significantly lower in hypothyroid patients on L-T4 therapy than in healthy controls, and patients' mean TSH was also lower than in controls.  A 2014 study ""Effect of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, DIO1 and DIO2 polymorphisms on L-thyroxine doses required for TSH suppression in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer"" confirmed an earlier study's finding of LD (linkage disequilibrium) between rs11206244 T and rs2235544 A in DIO1.  A 2013 study ""A Meta-Analysis of Thyroid-Related Traits Reveals Novel Loci and Gender-Specific Differences in the Regulation of Thyroid Function"" explained that ""even mild alterations in thyroid function are associated with weight changes, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disorders."" (Abstract). The study focused on genome-wide association data in 26,420 euthyroid (healthy, not hypothyroid or hyperthyroid) individuals phenotyped for serum TSH and 17,520 for FT4 levels. The meta-analysis highlighted a list of 26 SNPs from a wide variety of genes. * For DIO1 rs2235544 A/C, the A allele (51% frequency) was associated with an increase in FT4 levels, with a slightly larger effect on males than females. . This 2008 review discussed findings from previous research. The C allele of rs2235544 was associated with increased D1 function and increased FT3/T4 ratio.  rs225014, also known as Thr92Ala, represents a variant in the deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II DIO2 gene on chromosome 14. In dbSNP orientation for this SNP, the more common (T) allele encodes the Thr (threonine) and the somewhat less common (C) allele encodes the Ala (alanine) at this position in the DIO2 protein.Polymorphisms in this SNP have associations with various conditions in the literature: osteoarthritis, psychological disorders, reduced thyroid hormone metabolism, Type 2 diabetes, and various other conditions.==Osteoarthritis== A 2012 article titled ""Increased type II deiodinase protein in OA-affected cartilage and allelic imbalance of OA risk polymorphism rs225014 at DIO2 in human OA joint tissues"" identified that the minor 'C' allele was associated with a significant, 1.3-fold higher risk of osteoarthritis (OA) relative to the 'T' allele. A 2008 article titled ""Identification of DIO2 as a new susceptibility locus for symptomatic osteoarthritis"" explained that ""Confirmation and replication by association in the additional osteoarthritis studies indicated a common DIO2 haplotype, exclusively containing the minor allele of rs225014 and common allele of rs12885300, with a combined recessive odds ratio of 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-2.34 with P = 2.02 x 10(-5) in female cases with advanced/symptomatic hip osteoarthritis.""

(Abstract)==Thyroid hormone metabolism and treatment for hypothyroidism==. According to a 2009 study of 500 patients, hypothyroid patients on LT4 (Levothyroxine) therapy who don't show much improvement may have lower brain thyroid levels (not reflected in their serum levels) correlated to the number of rs225014(C) alleles they carry, and these patients may benefit from combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy.

This article stated ""A prevalent polymorphism in D2, Thr92AlaD2, has been associated with improved well-being on “combination therapy” with T4+T3; the underlying mechanism is unclear as T4-to-T3 conversion appears normal. Novel studies indicate this might be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. If the relationship between Thr92AlaD2-expression and treatment preference is confirmed, personalized medicine may play a role in hypothyroidism.""

However, rs762551(A) codes for the ""high inducibility"" form of the enzyme, characterized by higher enzyme activity in the presence of an inducer such as smoking or heavy coffee consumption . In non-smokers, there was no significant difference in CYP1A2 activity between the genotypes. In smokers, however, the A/A homozygotes had 1.6x higher CYP1A2 activity than A/C and C/C genotypes . Similarly, among non-smokers, only in heavy coffee consumers (more than 3 cups daily) the A/A homozygotes had about 1.4x higher CYP1A2 activity. There was no differences in CYP1A2 activity by genotype in non-heavy coffee consumers. A study of healthy premenopausal non-hormone using women concluded that drinkers of 3 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have lower breast volume (smaller breasts), but only if they had at least one rs762551(C) allele (p(interaction)=0.02), which was said to be consistent with reports that coffee protects only C-allele carriers against breast cancer.Another study by this same group looked at coffee consumption as related to breast cancer. Among 458 such patients (age 25-99 years), rs762551(A;A) women (about 1/2 of the total study) who drank 2 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have a later age at diagnosis compared with low coffee consumption (59.8 versus 52.6 years, p = 0.0004). These patients were also more likely to have ER- tumors than patients with low consumption (14.7% versus 0%, p = 0.018). Coffee consumption had no associations in carriers of a rs762551(C) allele.An independent study of 411 BRCA1 mutation carriers (170 cases and 241 controls) looked at the association between breast cancer, coffee consumption before age 35, and CYP1A2 genotype.

hsa,FCGR2A,"rs1801274 is a SNP in the Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIa, receptor (CD32) FCGR2A gene. rs1801274(C) encodes the arginine (R) allele, with the (T) allele encoding the variant histidine (H). The (H) isoform is considered high-binding to IgG2 and IgG3, while the (R) isoform is considered low-binding. This SNP is known in the literature by many names, including A519C and H131R. What's the importance of this? FcgR isoforms expressed on immune system cells have been linked to the pathogenic consequences triggered by autoantibodies or immune complexes in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as to the efficacy of some immunotherapeutic treatments such as rituximab.Many studies have been published about this FCGR2A SNP, roughly divided by either disorder or treatment as follows:* HIV to AIDS, including susceptibility and progression** In a study of HIV-infected men, those with a FCGR2a CC genotype progressed to a CD4+ cell count of <200/mm3 at a faster rate than individuals with either of the other genotypes (relative hazard = 1.6; p = 0.0001). However, the authors noted that the progression to AIDS was less impacted by this SNP, largely because TT homozygotes had an increased risk of pneumonia as an AIDS-defining illness. * Lymphoma** A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. The AG and AA genotypes of rs1801274 were associated with higher risk of follicular and small lymphocytic lymphomas: 1.26x (95% CI, 1.01-1.56) and 1.41x (95% CI, 1.10-1.81), respectively (P(trend) = 0.006).*Hemophilia A**In a case-control study of 85 individuals a more than 3-fold increased risk of inhibitor development was found compared to patients with the RR genotype* Malaria** Based on a study of more than 1,800 individuals in India, rs1801274(T;T) homozgyotes were significantly associated with protection from disease manifestation, with stronger association observed in the malaria non-endemic region. * Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)** A study of 90 Japanese patients with SLE concluded that individuals with rs1801274(C) alleles were at higher risk for the disease. Classifying the reports by immunotherapeutic treatment studied yields the following:* Studies involving cetuximab:** In a study of 39 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab, the rs1801274(T) (ie H) allele was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.055), by perhaps 1-2 months. * Studies involving infliximab:** A study of 91 patients with rheumatoid arthritis found that at week 30 of treatment with infliximab, rs1801274(C;C) homozygotes had a better ACR20 response (RR: 60% and HH-RH: 33.3%; p= 0.035). * Studies involving rituximab:** In a study of 58 Croatian patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rs1801274 did not influence response, event-free or overall survival. * Studies involving 3F8, an anti-GD2 antibody:** In a study of 136 patients with high risk neuroblastoma treated with the anti-GD2 antibody 3F8 plus GM-CSF immunotherapy, the rs1801274(C;C)(ie R/R) genotype was correlated with progression-free survival for the entire cohort (p = .049) and for the subset of patients with no history of prior relapse (p = .023).

SNP rs1057910(A), located in the cytochrome p450 CYP2C9 gene, most commonly encodes the amino acid isoleucine at position 359, and the resulting allele is also known as CYP2C9*1. rs1057910(C) encodes a leucine at this same position, and the resulting allele is called CYP2C9*3. This SNP is also known as Ile359Leu or A1075C.The effect of CYP2C9 variants on drug metabolism should not be predicted without also considering CYP2C9*2, defined as the common loss of function variant rs1799853(T) (NM_000771:c.430C>T, NP_000762:p.144R>C)   /. Studies of the effects of these alleles include:* rs1057910(C;C) genotypes may clear drugs like celecoxib (trade name Celebrex) twice as slowly as rs1057910(A;A) genotypes; the rs1057910(A;C) genotypes are in-between clearance rates. Lower clearance rates will lead to higher internal concentrations of the drug. It is not clear whether this could lead to increased efficacy and/or increased side effects. * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of tolbutamide, a sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drug used in the treatment of diabetes. * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of phenytoin, a drug used to treat epilepsy, and therefore tend to need lower doses.  Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) recommend testing for the HLA-B*15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN).* rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of glipizide, a second generation sulfonylurea drug structurally similar to tolbutamide and also used as an oral hypoglycemic agent. * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of warfarin, and therefore unusually sensitive.  * See also  OMIM 601130.0001Individuals carrying this SNP may show increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib.12x risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions when taking antiepileptic drug phenytoin.  rs1057911 is a SNP in the CYP2C9 gene.The rs1057911(T) allele defines the CYP2C9_50298A>T variant, about which little is known.Warfarin   Distribution of variant alleles association with warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the Han population in China.  rs1799853 is a SNP in the CYP2C9 gene and is linked to poor warfarin metabolism and risk of GI bleeding with some NSAID drugs. The common nomenclature for this polymorphism is CYP2C9*2 (Cys amino acid, T allele; the SNP is also known as C430T or Cys144Arg). Advanced knowledge of this may influence initial warfarin dosing by physicians. Warfarin is monitored through INR (international normalized ratio) and proper dosing is influenced by a variety of factors including warfarin metabolism and diet.  The rs1799853(T) allele encodes a variant amino acid, cysteine, which has been linked to poor metabolism of warfarin and thus sensitivity. The CYP2C9*2 allele is also associated with higher sensitivity to the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin. Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) mention concurrent testing for the HLA-B*15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN).

In a 2009 article titled ""Genetically based impairment in CYP2C8- and CYP2C9-dependent NSAID metabolism as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding: is a combination of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics required to improve personalized medicine?"" Authors reviewed prior research that argued:*Individuals carrying minor alleles of this both CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 AND CYP2C8*3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) have increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib. *In addition, carriers of the risk allele for CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 have decreased metabolism of Ibuprofen, Flurbiprofen, Piroxicam, and Tenoxicam.  *The presence of CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 allele alone does not confer risk with Diclofenac, but when it is combined with CYP2C8*3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080), Diclofenac induces hepatoxicity and confers risk of GI bleeding.    In a 2008 article (reviewed in ) titled ""Interaction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes modifies the risk for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related acute gastrointestinal bleeding,"" the study discovered that carriers of CYP2C8*3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a GI bleeding event risk OR=1.81 (95% CI=0.95–3.46; P=0.071) and risk increased if carriers drank more than 20g alcohol/day to an OR=1.99 (95% CI=1.06–3.74; P=0.034). As CYP2C8*3 and CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium, patients are likely to carry the risk allele to both 8*3 and 9*2, and when they do, The OR (95% CI) for carriers of such a genotype is increased to 1.94 (1.13–3.33), P=0.017.

hsa,GADL1,"rs17026651 is a SNP in an intron of the GADL1 gene. This SNP is tightly linked to another intronic SNP, rs17026688, and both are linked to what appears to be the key variant, known as 'GADL1 IVS8+48delG' (rs201973599).  See rs17026688 for full details. rs17026688 is a SNP located in an intron of the glutamate decarboxylase-like 1 GADL1 gene. It is linked to rs17026651, and both are 100% linked to a 1 base deletion known as 'GADL1 IVS8+48delG' (rs201973599).In a study of ~1,700 patients of Han Chinese descent with bipolar disorder, researchers discovered that almost all of the patients who responded well to lithium treatment had at least one IVS8+48delG GADL1 allele. Initially, the researchers were focused on two nearby SNPs, rs17026688 and rs17026651, that turned out to be proxies (due to being in high linkage disequilibrium) for the deletion variant. rs17026688(T) is the ""response allele"", meaning that at least in these Asian patients, bipolar patients who are carriers of at least one (T) allele are predicted to respond well to lithium treatment; rs17026688(C;C) patients are predicted to respond poorly.The odds ratios and probabilities for this study are so high that the authors are able to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV; NPV) for the connection between this DNA variant and being a bipolar patient who will respond well (or not) to lithium treatment. In a pooled cohort of ~400 patients, roughly divided equally between those responding well to lithium or not, the odds ratios, p values, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were around 80, 1 x 10e-50, 93%, 87%, 83% and 95%, respectively. To put it another way, while overall about half of all patients had a response allele and half didn't, only 1 in 14 patients who responded well to lithium lacked a response allele, and only 1 in 8 of those who did not respond well had a response allele. The authors naturally suggest the use of these SNPs as useful biomarkers for which patients with bipolar disorder will respond well to lithium treatment, and they also intend to (1) look for additional GADL1 gene variants acting similarly, especially in non-Asian populations given the rarity of this particular deletion variant outside of Asian population, and (2) see if these variants influence lithium treatment outcomes in other affective disorders such as major depressive disorder. rs201973599 is the SNP also known as IVS8+48delG, a single base deletion, in the GADL1 gene. It (the deletion version) has been reported to be highly predictive of good response to lithium treatment in Asian patients with bipolar disorder.

This HLA allele, in turn, has been associated with several conditions.A study of 51 cases of flucloxacillin drug-induced liver injury (DILI), an important cause of serious liver disease, along with a replication study of another 23 cases, found that the rs2395029(G) carriers were at highly increased risk (odds ratio 80, p=8.7x10(-33)).* see also: / 23andMe blog rs2395029(G;G) increases the odds of drug-induced liver injury in response to flucloxacillin by 45x This SNP is thought to be involved in determining the HIV viral load set point during the asymptomatic period of infection. This SNP is estimated to explain 9.6% of the total variation in the viral set point.Humans show remarkable variation in vulnerability to infection by HIV-1 and especially in the clinical outcome following infection. One striking and largely unexplained difference is the level of circulating virus in the plasma during the non-symptomatic phase preceding progression to AIDS. This is known as the ''viral set point'' and can vary among individuals by as much as 4 to 5 logs. The HCP5 (HLA complex P5) gene is located 100 kb centromeric from HLAB on chromosome 6.  HCP5 is a good candidate to interact with HIV-1, possibly through an antisense mechanism. Moreover, HCP5 is predicted to encode two proteins, and the associated polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution in one of these.rs9264942 is also reported to be associated with reduced HIV viral load set point.In most European populations, the rs2395029(G) allele is in tight linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 1) with the HLA-B*5701 allele, and therefore is predictive of hypersensitivity to the drug abacavir, an antiviral used to treat HIV+ individuals.

For multiple reasons discussed below, interpretation of the impact of this SNP is highly problematic.In addition to the reporting discrepancies between two different DTC labs (AncestryDNA and 23andMe) discussed below, the ClinVar record is decidedly mixed about whether this is, or is not, a pathogenic mutation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. After initially being classified of uncertain significance in 2011 by LabCorp, it was classified as benign in 2013 by both an NIH lab and by GeneDx, but in 2014, GeneDx re-classified it as pathogenic. Furthermore, in a dissertation published in July 2015 for a Masters in Genetic Counseling , rs11570112 was discussed in depth as a variant with conflicting interpretation between ClinVar and labs in the SHaRe academic consortium specializing in cardiomyopathy diagnosis /, citing one group as saying it was benign and the other of uncertain significance.AncestryDNA seems to report the common genotype for this SNP on OpenSNP as C,C on the plus strand, which shows up as G,G on the minus strand in Promethease.  23andme seems to report the common genotype for this SNP as GG on the plus strand, which shows up as C,C on the minus strand on Promethease.  This is an ambiguous flip (C/G).  Th first 10 or so C,C checked on OpenSNP were all AncestyDNA reports, and given the extremely low frequency of the pathogenic allele, this is most likely an ambiguous flip problem.  AncestryDNA users with a homozygous ""pathogenic"" GG reported by Promethease seem more likely to be wild type.  Additionally, both C,C and G,G are far more common on OpenSNP than C,G, which deviates from Hardy-Weinberg.

Allograft survival data did not show statistical differences between genotypes.  rs2292399 and rs2903692 both significantly associated with type 1 diabetes odds ratio 1.37 and 1.28.

However, a subsequent study based on over 2,000 parent-child trios (ie families) failed to find any evidence of either effect.",,,SNPedia
hsa,GATA3,"'''rs4143094''' is a SNP identified by a genome-wide diet-gene interaction analysis (GxE), and was found to be associated with increased risk of colon cancer correlated to the dietary variable of processed meat consumption. It is located on chromosome 10p14, 7.2kb upstream of GATA binding protein 3 (''GATA3''), in the promoter region of the gene  rs4143094 was identified in a screen of 2.7 million SNPs for the risk of colorectal cancer, by combining 10 studies comparing 9287 cases and 9117 controls. Data was obtained from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and analyzed by conventional case-control logistic regression for multiplicative interactions between SNPs and dietary factors. rs4143094 was the most significantly implicated SNP in 10p14 for processed meat consumption linked with occurrence of colorectal cancer. The risk allele (T) has an ORinteraction=1.17, p=8.73E-09 with evidenced heterogenetity by p=0.78. When stratifying by genotype, rs4143094-TG has OR=1.2, 95% CI=1.13-1.26; rs4143094-TT has an OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.22-1.59; and the minor/null genotype rs4143094-GG has an OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.98-1.07.  Several other SNPs in the 10p14 region were correlated to the same phenotype, (rs485411, risk allele C, ORinteraction=1.18; Pinteraction=1.72E-08; rs1269486, risk allele A, ORinteraction=1.18, Pinteraction=7.53E-08) though rs4143094 was highlighted due to having the most significant P-value.Colorectal cancer is the third most leading cause of cancer death in men and women , and consumption of processed meat has been linked to increased risk of its development , . rs4143094 is upstream of ''GATA3'', a gene associated with Th2 cell differentiation , which is upregulated in ulcerative colitis , a risk factor for colorectal cancer . Though the mechanism by which ''GATA3'' suppression may lead to increased risk of colorectal cancer is unknown, its suppression has been previously linked to breast, colorectal, and lung cancers . DOJ  Association between risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat.rs4143094 on chromosome 10p14 is about 7.2kb upstream of GATA3 gene. GATA3 belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors. Its functional role includes regulation of luminal epithelial cell differentiation, development of T cell, and differentiation of T helper (Th) cell. Genes in the GATA family are involved in several types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and of particular interest to this entry, colorectal cancer    . According to dbSNP, rs4143094 has two alleles, G (major allele) and T (minor allele). The minor allele has a frequency of 0.2337 across all populations. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), using data from Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), discovered a strong correlation between rs4143094 and risk of colorectal cancer when ingesting red and processed meat . In the study, approximately 2.7M SNPs were tested across 9,287 case and 9,117 control subjects, all with European ancestry. The result shows that rs4143094 is associated with risk of colorectal cancer (P = 8.73e-9), with T being the risk allele. Specifically, individuals with TG and TT genotypes are increased for occurrence of colorectal cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 and 1.39, respectively. rs4143094 resides in a 9.5 kb linkage-disequilibrium (LD) block (r2 > 0.8) containing 19 highly correlated SNPs. The third most significant among these SNPs, rs1269486, is located 1420 bases upstream of GATA3 and is in a region of open chromatin (DNA hypersensitivity). Experimental evidence suggests binding activity of Pol2 and transcription factors c-Fos, JunD, and c-Jun in this region . Many other SNPs in the LD block reside in GATA3-antisense RNA1 (GATA3-AS1).  GATA3-AS1 may regulate GATA3 transcript activity, although further experimental evidence is required. Apart from the SNP, this study also observed that red and processed meat consumption increases risk for colorectal cancer with OR of 1.15 and 1.11, respectively. For this secondary result, the author proposed the following pathway: processed meat triggers pro-tumorigenic inflammatory or immunological response, whose recovery depends upon the expression of GATA3 gene. Further experimental evidence is required to confirm this hypothesis.    A study of 6,388 cases and 4,995 controls from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and 5,617 BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) concluded that there is no evidence that rs570613 is associated with breast cancer risk in women.",,,SNPedia

Dust mite exposure modifies the effect of functional IL10 polymorphisms on allergy and asthma exacerbations.Dust mite exposure significantly modified the relation between 3 SNPs in IL10 (rs1800896, rs3024492, and rs3024496). Homozygosity for the minor allele of each of the 3 SNPs was associated with increased risk of occurrence ( approximately 3-fold to 39-fold increase).A study of 258 prostate cancer cases concluded that the rs1800896(A) allele, known to result in lower levels of this anti-inflammatory cytokine, was positively associated with risk (AG vs. GG, odds ratio of 1.69, CI: 1.10-2.60; AA vs. GG, OR of 1.81, CI: 1.11-2.96).   rs2222202 (C/T) (p=0.03) and rs1800871 (C/T) (p=0.05) showed significant allelic associations with pediatric onset Crohn's disease.   According to a 2010 report, each A (minor) allele at rs3024490 in the IL10 gene increased the risk of Beh&#231;et's disease about 1.4 times in a Turkish population.   The aim of the study was to map SNP/gene associations with environmental pathogen-richness in relation to genomic variations across geographic human populations. This 2009 article found that ""six risk alleles for inflammatory bowel (IBD) or celiac disease are significantly correlated with micropathogen richness. These data support the hygiene hypothesis for IBD and provide a large set of putative targets for susceptibility to helminth infections."" (Abstract) Table I. identified rs3024490 among a list of 44 SNPs analyzed in relation to micro- and macro-pathogens. This SNP was not previously associated with IBD and celiac disease and was negatively associated with pathogen richness.  This 2009 study identified a haplotype among Ghanaians consisting of minor alleles at four SNPs in the IL-10 gene: rs1800871, rs1800872, rs3024490 and rs1554286. This combination of risk alleles led to lower IL-10 expression and higher TNF gene expression, resulting in a pro-inflammatory response. The authors explain that in Ghana, ""pro-inflammatory alleles rescue their carriers of excess mortality in adverse environmental conditions"" such as drinking from boreholes, and thus minor alleles occur more frequently in African populations, but ""in an affluent environment, the same pro-inflammatory response leads to increased mortality,"" and minor alleles occur much less frequently (i.e. in Caucasian populations).

The normal allele is (C); all three possible variants are reported as considered causative for Parkinson's disease.

Also known as R1628P, rs33949390 is a SNP in the LRRK2 gene.A study of Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease concluded that in this population, after adjustments were made for age, age of onset, and gender, rs33949390(C) carriers were 3.3x more likely to develop the disease than noncarriers (CI: 1.4- 7.9, p = 0.007). rs33995883, also known as c.6241A>G, p.Asn2081Asp and N2081D, represents a variant in the LRKK2 gene on chromosome 12.The minor allele of this SNP was initially reported as potentially associated with Parkinson's disease; however, more recent reviews as well as the current annotation in ClinVar all conclude it is benign (at least with respect to Parkinson's). In 2018, a study of 2,000 patients with Crohn's disease found somewhat increased (~2x) risk for the disorder to be associated with rs33995883(G).  rs34594498, also known as c.1256C>T, p.Ala419Val and A419V, represents a variant in the LRRK2 gene on chromosome 12.The minor allele of this variant has been reported in some studies - and not others - to increase risk (by about 2x) for Parkinson's disease, primarily in studies of Asians. Some of the studies confirming or refuting this variant's role include:<u>Reporting an association:</u>*  2015 study reports a ~2x higher risk for PD in Chinese patients and based on meta-analysis;*  2011 study reports a ~2x higher risk for PD in Asian patients (but not Caucasians)<u>Finding no association:</u>*  2013 study of ~400 Chinese, Malays and Indians finds no association*  2012 study of ~600 Taiwenese PD patients reported no association*  2012 study of ~1,500 Chinese PD patients reported no association Note that this 2006 study concluded that Ala419Val was a ""disease-unrelated polymorphism"". First discovered in 2004, rs34637584 is a SNP indicating a position within the LRRK2 that encodes a variant protein. This SNP is commonly referred to as the G2019S variant (or, mutation) based on the potential change from glycine (encoded by rs34637584(G) allele) to serine (encoded by the rs34637584(A) allele) at position 2019 of the LRRK2 protein.Note: as of June 2016, we have noticed that this SNP is prone to being miscalled in AncestryDNA V2.0 datasets.One copy of a rs34637584(A) allele is sufficient to greatly increase one's risk for Parkinson's disease. It is considered a disease causing mutation because it is rarely found in healthy, elderly people without Parkinson's disease, and it has been found in both familial and sporadic types of the disease. While there are many different SNPs that can influence one's risk for Parkinson's disease, rs34637584 is an especially common cause of the disease in Berber Arabs and Ashkenazi Jews. Overall, the risk of Parkinson's disease for a person who inherits a rs34637584(A) allele is 28% at age 59, 51% at 69, and 74% at 79, according to the International LRRK2 Consortium.This SNP  has been associated with disease at varying frequencies in Asian (<1%), European (1%&#8211;7%), North American (1%&#8211;3%), North African (34-41%), and Ashkenazi (10&#8211;25%) sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease patient populations .The G2019S mutation is also common not only in Parkinson's disease patients but also in controls at a frequency of 2.2% in North African Berber-Arabs (13/597, ), 1.4% in Sephardic Jews (5/361, ) and 1.3% in Ashkenazic Jews (4/317, ) while it is found at a very low frequency of 0.06% in Europeans (1/1550, ) and not found in sub-Saharan Africans.Individuals with G2019S who share the most common haplotype (mainly Europeans, Jews and North-Africans) very likely share a common ancestor estimated to have lived 1,525&#8211;1,830 years ago between the second and fifth centuries A.D. either in the Middle East  or in  North Africa . In contrast, other authors hypothesized that LRRK2 G2019S might be of Phoenician origin, rather than Arabic-Berber or Jewish, dating from the founding of ancient Carthage in 814 B.C. . G2019S has been observed on two additional background haplotypes (one in European&#8211;Americans and one in Japanese) distinct from the main one observed in Europeans, North-Africans and Jews. This suggests that G2019S has arisen independently on at least three separate occasions. According to the most extensive and thorough study by Lesage et al. in 2010, estimations indicated that the LRRK2 mutation on the main haplotype initially arose among Near-Easterners at least 4,000 years ago, much earlier than in previous estimations. Because of a founder effect, the ancestors of present-day Ashkenazi Jews may have kept the low-frequency G2019S mutation through the different diasporas, whereas Near Eastern daughter populations lost the mutation. ""The mutation might then have been reintroduced by recurrent gene flow from Ashkenazi populations to other Jewish, European and North-African populations. The present-day frequency of the mutation in control populations (0.05% in Europeans, 0.5% in North-African Arabs and 1% in Ashkenazi Jews) may support this scenario""Is a carrier of at least one rs34637584(A) allele definitely going to develop Parkinson's disease if they live long enough? No. Several studies have found that overall the odds of developing the disease for G2019S carriers depends on age, family history, and ethnicity. The odds for G2019S carriers were calculated to be 15% at 60 years, 21% at 70 years, and 32% at 80 years in a study of Italian patients , whereas in a Jewish population the age-specific odds were 24% at age 80.Having a family history of Parkinson's disease in addition to carrying a rs34637584(A) allele is also associated with increased risk for the disease.Do the odds differ between carriers of one and two rs34637584(A) alleles? Apparently not; a study of North Africans - one of the few populations likely to have sufficient numbers of homozygote rs34637584(A;A) individuals to study due to the rarity of the mutation - there was no clinical difference between Parkinson's disease patients carrying one or two copies, and, 3 individuals (ranging from 42-70 years old) who were rs34637584(A;A) and yet did not have the disease were also observed.In 2019, a study concluded that compared to Parkinson patients due to other causes, G2019S-associated Parkinson patients had a ~10-fold higher chance of developing leukemia and a 2-fold higher chance of developing colon cancer, perhaps thereby meriting additional screening for those conditions. However, it was not clear if higher odds would have been seen in G2019S-carriers compared to healthy individuals not carrying the G2019S mutation.This SNP was in the news  in 2008 as one of Google's founders, Sergey Brin, announced that he and his mother (who has Parkinson's disease) both carry the G2019S SNP. Mr. Brin was 35 years old at the time of the announcement, and in his / blog, he comments that ""I now have the opportunity to adjust my life to reduce those odds"", which he states are ""somewhere between 20% to 80% depending on the study and how you measure"". Helixgene discusses this  extensively and concludes that people with G2019S have about a 25% chance of Parkinson's disease in their lifetime. This chance is greatly influenced by other factors including ethnicity and family history. BMC in LRRK2 is not fully penetrant in familial Parkinson's Disease and  commentarygs248 is relevant  In perfect contrast to another SNP also within the LRRK2 gene, rs34637584, this SNP, rs34778348, is not found in Caucasian populations but is found in Asian populations.A case-control study of 989 Chinese subjects concluded that the odds ratio for Parkinson's disease was 2.1 for rs34778348(A) carriers (CI: 1.1-3.9, p = 0.014).

The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome was reported to be around 6% for non-carriers of c.2161C>T but approximately 50% for carriers of this (c.2161C>T) variant.  alpha-MyHC is also associated with a 4.16-beat per minute decrease in heart rate (p=0.0019).The minor allele (T) results in a missense mutation in the ''MYH6'' gene, encoding the alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MyHC) protein.  This protein is a fast ATPase present mainly in atrial tissue.  The p.Arg721Trp variant resides in part of the converter domain of alpha-MyHC and is important for amplifying structural rearrangements of myosin during contraction.  This variant has been predicted to result in structural alterations .       As of May 2011, no frequency data are available.            rs365990 is a nonsynonymous SNP in exon 25 of the ''MYH6'' gene, coding for the alpha myosin heavy chain (alpha-MyHC) protein.  The A->G nucleotide change results in the A1101V missense mutation in alpha-MyHc.   rs365990 was discovered in a study conducted by deCODE Genetics  as being most significantly associated primarily with heart rate, but also with PR interval.  In the Icelandic cohort of ~10,000 individuals in the discovery phase and an additional ~10,000 individuals in the follow-up phase, the rs365990 G allele frequency was 0.34, and the G allele was associated with decreased heart rate (p=9.4E-11 for both phases combined) and with a prolonged PR interval (p=1.8E-5 combined).  After adjusting for heart rate, the association of rs365990 with PR interval maintained significance (p=0.0027 combined).  rs365990G is associated with a 0.91-beat decrease in heart rate per minute .  This was replicated in a meta-analysis of 38,991 individuals of European descent, where the A allele of rs452306 was found to be associated with with a 0.58bpm decrease in resting heart rate per A allele .  rs452306 is in linkage disequilibrium with rs365990 (r2=0.96 in HapMap CEU), and it was suggested that rs365990 is the functional variant.    It was not, however, associated with atrial fibrillation (p=0.14 combined), pacemaker (p=0.13 combined), sick sinus syndrome (p=0.18 combined), or advanced AV block (p=0.33 combined).",,,SNPedia

hsa,UGT1A4,"Clinically relevant UGT1A10 variant.               UGT1A1*28 duplication allele inserts a seventh (TA) pair to six (TA) pairs this reducing the activity to 30% of normal.See the following SNPs, which have been merged to rs3064744 on dbSNP:rs34815109rs35600288  Although the insertion is supposed to be the minor allele, the majority of FTDNA v2 and 23andMe v2 results show II as the result, so use caution when interpreting this result.rs34815109 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers. These risks include:* An increased risk for breast cancer is reported in premenopausal African-American women, based on a study of 200 women. The reported odds ratio was 1.8 (CI: 1.0-3.1, p=0.06) for carriers of one or more UGT1A1*28 alleles.* In colorectal cancer patients being treated with irinotecan, adverse side effects (neutropenia and/or severe diarrhea) are reported to be strongly associated with the number of UGT1A1*28 alleles. Patients homozygous for the *28 allele are 3.5 times more likely to develop severe neutropenia compared with individuals with the wild genotype. The FDA has approved a genetic test for UGT1A1 status to be used to determine dosage when considering irinotecan therapy  FDA press release. However, no prospective study has examined whether a reduced dose of irinotecan results in a reduced rate of adverse drug events.* Hyperbilirubinemia, a potentially toxic increase in bilirubin levels, is possible among rs34815109(TA;TA) individuals treated with the drug tranilast.The three other SNPs that describe the same polymorphism are:* rs34983651* rs35600288* rs5839491  rs34983651 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene; the primary entry in SNPedia for this set of SNPs is at rs34815109.

In general, based on Promethease user data, it appears as if Ancestry's v2c and v2d chips interpret the normal allele as ""D"", whereas 23andMe v2-v4 chips interpret it as ""I"". These chips (v2-v4) appear to have false negatives for this SNP, and this SNP is not reported on the v5 chip.    rs35600288 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene; the primary entry in SNPedia for this set of SNPs is at rs34815109.The other two SNPs (besides rs34815109) that also describe the same polymorphism are:* rs34983651* rs5839491 aka c.-1352A= (and probably also c.-1353A=)The ""A"" variant (T in dbSNP orientation) has been observed in a few Japanese newborns with hyperbilirubinemia, but the association is hardly causative, and even the authors conclude the pathogenicity is ""uncertain"".

More recent analyses have concluded that the rs61735045(A) allele is quite likely to actually be benign. A 2009 publication found that the frequency of the 530S allele was similar (about 5%) in all groups of people they studied, whether healthy or EDS-affected. Furthermore, the predicted homozygote minor frequency of 1 in 400 people is much higher than that of classical EDS. More recently, ExAC analysis shows an allele frequency of 3.5%, and a minor homozygote frequency of about 1 in 1000, which is still an order of magnitude or more higher than the estimated EDS incidence, incidating that either this allele is benign or the penetrance of even a double mutation is quite low.Additionally, as of 2014, two labs are reporting in ClinVar this variant as benign.

A study in Ashkenazi Jews showed that individuals homozygotic for the G allele have significantly longer lifespans.New research also indicates that G homozygotes have an average of 70% less risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The study also found that heterozygotes have a lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease but more study is needed to determine the risk reduction for heterozygotes. See  Association of a Functional Polymorphism in the Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) Gene With Memory Decline and Incidence of Dementia and  CETP Variant Linked to Slower Cognitive Decline and Reduced Dementia Risk . rs708272, also known as the TaqIB polymorphism of the CETP gene, may influence the levels of the ""good"" cholesterols, the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterols. Generally, the B2 allele is considered to lead to higher HDL levels.However, high HDL cholesterol, at least when combined with another HDL raising SNP (rs1800588), doesn't appear to actually protect individuals from coronary artery disease, at least based on one study of ~800 Caucasian male patients. A similarly confusing picture emerges from a study of two populations of 10,000+ individuals each. The distribution of the CETP genotype was observed to be different in population-based studies compared with studies in populations selected by high cardiovascular risk, and contradictory results were seen when trying to figure out if the TaqIB SNP predicted whether drugs would lower plasma lipids or cardiovascular outcome.A meta-analysis concluded that there probably was a statistically significant, but weak, association for this SNP. For each rs708272(T) allele inherited, individuals had lower mean CETP mass (-9.7%; CI: -11.7% to -7.8%), lower mean CETP activity (-8.6%; CI: -13.0% to -4.1%), higher mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (4.5%; CI: 3.8%-5.2%), and higher mean apolipoprotein A-I concentrations (2.4%; CI, 1.6%-3.2%). The combined per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for coronary disease were 0.95 (CI: 0.92-0.99).A prospective cohort study of 18,245 initially healthy American women over a 10-year period found similar results with respect to HDL-C levels and (inversely) risk of myocardial infarction; rs708272(T) was associated with a per-allele increase in HDL-C levels of 3.1 mg/dL and a concordant 24 percent lower risk of future myocardial infarction (age-adjusted HR 0.76, CI: 0.62-0.94).rs708272 has also been associated with reduced coronary heart disease risk in those drinking alcohol. More specifically, a 2014 study by Mehlig et al., ( studying 618 patients with CHD found that the B2B2 genotype, rs708272(T;T)), had a reduced risk (odds ratio 0.21) for CHD in intermediate vs low drinkers.

This SNP is also known as Ile359Leu or A1075C.The effect of CYP2C9 variants on drug metabolism should not be predicted without also considering CYP2C9*2, defined as the common loss of function variant rs1799853(T) (NM_000771:c.430C>T, NP_000762:p.144R>C)   /. Studies of the effects of these alleles include:* rs1057910(C;C) genotypes may clear drugs like celecoxib (trade name Celebrex) twice as slowly as rs1057910(A;A) genotypes; the rs1057910(A;C) genotypes are in-between clearance rates. Lower clearance rates will lead to higher internal concentrations of the drug. It is not clear whether this could lead to increased efficacy and/or increased side effects. * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of tolbutamide, a sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drug used in the treatment of diabetes. * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of phenytoin, a drug used to treat epilepsy, and therefore tend to need lower doses.  Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) recommend testing for the HLA-B*15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN).* rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of glipizide, a second generation sulfonylurea drug structurally similar to tolbutamide and also used as an oral hypoglycemic agent. * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of warfarin, and therefore unusually sensitive.  * See also  OMIM 601130.0001Individuals carrying this SNP may show increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib.12x risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions when taking antiepileptic drug phenytoin.      rs1799853 is a SNP in the CYP2C9 gene and is linked to poor warfarin metabolism and risk of GI bleeding with some NSAID drugs. The common nomenclature for this polymorphism is CYP2C9*2 (Cys amino acid, T allele; the SNP is also known as C430T or Cys144Arg). Advanced knowledge of this may influence initial warfarin dosing by physicians. Warfarin is monitored through INR (international normalized ratio) and proper dosing is influenced by a variety of factors including warfarin metabolism and diet.  The rs1799853(T) allele encodes a variant amino acid, cysteine, which has been linked to poor metabolism of warfarin and thus sensitivity. The CYP2C9*2 allele is also associated with higher sensitivity to the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin. Note however that the / CPIC (and  FDA) mention concurrent testing for the HLA-B*15:02 allele, since carriers are at significantly increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS/PTEN).

In a 2009 article titled ""Genetically based impairment in CYP2C8- and CYP2C9-dependent NSAID metabolism as a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding: is a combination of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics required to improve personalized medicine?"" Authors reviewed prior research that argued:*Individuals carrying minor alleles of this both CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 AND CYP2C8*3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) have increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of NSAIDs that are CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates, such as aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib. *In addition, carriers of the risk allele for CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 have decreased metabolism of Ibuprofen, Flurbiprofen, Piroxicam, and Tenoxicam.  *The presence of CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 allele alone does not confer risk with Diclofenac, but when it is combined with CYP2C8*3 (rs10509681 and rs11572080), Diclofenac induces hepatoxicity and confers risk of GI bleeding.    In a 2008 article (reviewed in ) titled ""Interaction of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes modifies the risk for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related acute gastrointestinal bleeding,"" the study discovered that carriers of CYP2C8*3 (a minor allele of both rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a GI bleeding event risk OR=1.81 (95% CI=0.95–3.46; P=0.071) and risk increased if carriers drank more than 20g alcohol/day to an OR=1.99 (95% CI=1.06–3.74; P=0.034). As CYP2C8*3 and CYP2C9*2 rs1799853 variant alleles are in linkage disequilibrium, patients are likely to carry the risk allele to both 8*3 and 9*2, and when they do, The OR (95% CI) for carriers of such a genotype is increased to 1.94 (1.13–3.33), P=0.017.

PharmGKB summary: phenytoin pathway.   influences warfarin dose influences warfarin dose influences warfarin dose      rs8050894, is located on chromosome 16 in the gene VKORC1.  VKORC1 is the primary target of the drug warfarin (Coumadin), a commonly used oral anticoagulant.  rs8050894 is one of several polymorphisms found in VKORC1 that is associated with specific warfarin doses ().  Other polymorphisms in VKORC1 (rs7196161, rs9923231, rs9934438, rs2359612) are equally predictive of warfarin dose requirement in both European and Asian-descent individuals.Other polymorphisms found in the gene cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) influence the metabolism of warfarin and have a smaller effect on warfarin dose.  These polymorphisms are rs1799853 (CYP2C9*2) and rs1057910 (CYP2C9*3). In several hundred Europeans, no association was found between rs8050894 and risk for ischemic stroke.

Estimation of the warfarin dose with clinical and pharmacogenetic data. Warfarin sensitivity genotyping: a review of the literature and summary of patient experience. The genomic ancestry of individuals from different geographical regions of Brazil is more uniform than expected. Several SNPs in the VKORC1 gene have been linked to warfarin sensitivity, with perhaps the most common being this SNP rs9923231.  Note that the orientation as published in scientific articles is often on the opposite strand compared to the orientation in dbSNP, so you will sometimes see it as a G>A snp. It is also known as *-1639G>A with the minus indicating that this is in an upstream promoter *3673 based on its position in GenBank accession number AY587020.*VKORC1*2. The main findings related to the treatment of venous thromboembolism (aka VTE; from hypercoagulability) with the blood thinner warfarin for this SNP are that carriers of the rs9923231(T) allele require significantly reduced doses of warfarin, and are (otherwise) at a higher risk of serious bleeding. Clinical studies demonstrate that rs9923231(A), and the tightly linked intron1 SNP rs9934438(T)  predict warfarin dose more accurately than intron 2 SNP 1542G>C in blacks. Increased warfarin dose requirement in blacks was accounted for by lower frequency of the rs9923231(T) allele. Therefore, the T allele at rs9923231 is a suitable biomarker for warfarin dosing across ethnic populations.   risk of aortic calcification was calculated, adjusted for potential confounders. The T allele frequency of the VKORC1 1173C>T polymorphism was 38.8%. 1185 (37.2%) persons were homozygous CC, 1529 (48,0%) were heterozygous CT and 473 (14.8%) were homozygous TT. Persons with at least one T-allele had a statistically significant 19% (95% CI 2 to 40%) risk increase of calcification of the aortic far wall compared to CC homozygous persons",,,SNPedia

This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers.

The risk allele is rs1219648(G), with a pooled odds ratio of 1.64 (CI:1.42-1.90) for rs1219648(G;G) homozygotes, and an odds ratio of 1.20 (CI: 1.07-1.42) for rs1219648(A;G) heterozygotes, compared with rs1219648(A;A) homozygotes.rs1219648 represents the SNP in the FGFR2 gene with the strongest association with breast cancer. However, nearby SNPs are almost as predictive. In particular, the following SNP alleles all have linkage values of 0.96 or greater with the rs1219648(G) allele in European populations:*rs2981579(A)*rs2420946(T)*rs11200014(A) An experimental rationale is presented indicating that this SNP is part of a haplotype that increases risk for ER+ breast cancer by increasing FGFR2 transcription.  rs1219648 is not associated with endometriosis risk. rs1219648 may account for a substantial fraction of breast cancer in Arab (12%), Ashkenazi (15%), and Sephardi Jewish (22%) populations.  Based on a study of 1,049 Chinese breast cancer patients, carriers of risk alleles at three SNPs (rs2981582, rs1219648 and rs2420946) were at 1.36x increased risk for breast cancer (CI: 1.13-1.62, p = 0.001).

The rs1042713(G) allele encodes the G/glycine form that is the more common one in most populations, while rs1042713(A) encodes the R/arginine residue at this position of the ADRB2 protein.A study of 1,182 young Scottish asthma patients (age, 3-22 years) concluded that rs1042713(A) alleles are significantly associated with ""exacerbations"" of their condition, regardless of treatment regimens (odds ratio 1.30, CI: 1.09-1.55, p=0.003). This didn't hold true for patients using inhalers less than once per day; and it was particularly true for those receiving daily inhaled long- or short-acting beta(2)-agonist treatment (OR, 1.64, CI: 1.22-2.20, p=.001). This may therefore indicate that regular inhalant use may be counter-productive in young asthma patients carrying one or especially two rs1042713(A) alleles. Several susceptibilities have been linked to rs1042714, a SNP in the ADRB2 gene that is also known as the Q27E SNP. The rs1042714(C) allele encodes the glutamine (Gln; ""Q""), and the rs1042714(G) allele encodes the glutamic acid (Glu; ""E"").A study of 304 patients found that the Glu27 allele led to increased risk for idiopathic venous thromboembolism; the reported odds ratio was 1.40 (CI: 1.09-1.79, p=0.006) for carriers of at least one risk allele.A study of 334 families with at least one child with autism found that increased risk associated with the rs1042714(G;G) homozygous genotype; the odds ratio reported was between 1.33-1.60 (CI: 1.07-2.58). The risk was approximately doubled among mothers who had clinical markers for pregnancy related stress. In a study of 342 patients with type-2 diabetes, the rs1042714(G;G) genotype was associated with reduced risk compared to carriers of a rs1042714(C) allele, with an odds ratio of 0.56 (CI: 0.36-0.91).A study of 294 Italian ischemic stroke patients found increased risk associated with the rs1042714(G;G) genotype, with an odds ratio of 1.68 (CI: 1.17-2.41, p=0.005).A large study of almost 8,000 patients found no consistent evidence for association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or hypertension, however, there was some association between the rs1042714(G) allele and systolic blood pressure.Among 215 adults treated with topical beta-blockers to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), rs1042714(C;C) genotypes were significantly more likely to experience a (desirable) IOP decrease of 20% or more (odds ratio 2.00, CI: 1.00-4.02).        asthma related  rs1800888, also known as Ile164, is a SNP in the beta 2 adrenergic receptor ADRB2 gene.

This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers. These risks include:* An increased risk for breast cancer is reported in premenopausal African-American women, based on a study of 200 women. The reported odds ratio was 1.8 (CI: 1.0-3.1, p=0.06) for carriers of one or more UGT1A1*28 alleles.* In colorectal cancer patients being treated with irinotecan, adverse side effects (neutropenia and/or severe diarrhea) are reported to be strongly associated with the number of UGT1A1*28 alleles.

The wild-type (non-deletion) allele is a bit more common than the deletion allele in most populations. Several studies have linked this SNP to alterations in folic acid (and folate) metabolism. A study of 1,215 subjects  from the Framingham Offspring Study concluded that rs70991108 influences the prevalence of circulating folic acid levels. Specifically, folic acid intake over 500ug/d led to high circulating (unmetabolized) folic acid levels in subjects homozygous for the deletion genotype. When folic acid intake was under 250ug/d, the deletion/deletion homozygotes had lower RBC folate (732.2 nmol/L) compared with the non-deletion genotype (844.4 nmol/L). A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs70991108 deletion allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment.

The resulting rs6025(A) allele encodes a mutation known as the Leiden mutation, R506Q. This mutation is often referred to as the G1691A or 1691G-A change.See the  OMIM entryIn a 2017 study using UK Biobank, based on 3290 VTE cases and 116 868 controls, the odds ratio for a polymorphism involving the minor risk allele was 3.5. They also found higher odds for venous thromboembolism in overweight individuals (+1.57 for every 1 SD higher BMI).  In a 2013 meta-analysis of 31 databases, the analysis of Factor V rs6025 variants was based on 9,081 cases and 17,513 controls. The polymorphic variant risk for Venous Thromboembolism was overall OR: 4.38. The risk was greater in younger subjects (<45 years old, OR: 5.43; ≥45 years old, OR: 3.71). Slightly higher risk appeared in men (OR: 5.06) and in women taking oral contraceptives (OR: 6.10). The AG polymorphic variant was associated with recurrent thrombosis (recurrent VTE event, OR: 5.81; no recurrence reported, OR: 3.95). The higher risks were for venous thrombosis without evidence of pulmonary embolism (OR: 4.49) or a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (OR: 4.14). The AA homozygous variant was rarer, and its risk was significantly higher at 11.45 but was based on fewer individuals (116 subjects among cases and 24 controls). Independent risk was seen in variants of the PT20210A or Factor 2 SNP at i3002432 (also known as rs1799963 ) Other studies have come to similar conclusions. In a 2004 study of over 9,000 Caucasian adults in the Danish population, rs6025(A;G) and rs6025(A;A) genotypes had 2.7x and 18x higher risk for venous thromboembolism, respectively, than rs6025(G;G) individuals. The lowest absolute 10-year risks for venous thromboembolism for (A;G) and (A;A) genotypes were 0.7% (CI: 0.5% to 1.0%) and 3% (CI: 1% to 8%) for nonsmokers younger than 40 years of age with a body mass index below 25 kg/m2, and the corresponding highest risks were 10% (CI: 7% to 14%) and 51% (CI: 13% to 100%) for overweight smokers over 60.In a study done in the year 2000 on 119 women, it was found that women who are pregnant and rs6025(A) carriers could be at risk for obstetric complications, including pre-eclampsia or venous thromboembolism, especially if they were also prothrombin rs1799963 heterozygotes and/or have a family history of thrombosis. They concluded that if you assume an overall risk rate of 1 in 1500 pregnancies, the risk of thrombosis among rs6025(A)  carriers by itself would be 0.2 percent (1 in 500); among carriers of the prothrombin rs1799963(A) by itself, would be 0.5 percent (1 in 200); and among carriers of both variant SNPs, 4.6 percent (about 1 in 20).A 2006 review article of 10 previous studies found that women who are rs6025(A) carriers also are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism and perhaps ischemic stroke when they take combined oral contraceptives (i.e. ""the pill""). A 2006 literature meta-analysis from a total of 10 studies concluded that ""good"" evidence existed for a greater risk of venous thromboembolism (risk ratios of 1.3-25.1) and cerebral vein or cerebral sinus thrombosis when comparing heterozygotes taking such contraceptives to heterozygotes who did not. Additionally, a 2004 meta-analysis involving 18,000 cases and 58,000 controls found an increased risk for ischemic stroke for rs6025(A) carriers. The odds ratio based on a study of ~4,500 patients was 1.33, CI: 1.12-1.58.Although preliminary, a 2010 study found that women taking tamoxifen as part of their treatment for early-stage breast cancer, those who had a thromboembolic event were nearly five times more likely to have a rs6025(A) allele compared to those who did not have a TE. The authors suggest that postmenopausal women should be evaluated for the rs6025(A) SNP before being given a prescription for tamoxifen if the result would affect the decision. A related editorial pointed out that tamoxifen on its own is known to increase the risk of thromboembolic events 2-4 fold.According to a 1999 Blood journal article, coexistence of the R2 polymorphism rs1800595 with factor V Leiden increased the risk for venous thrombosis approximately to a 16-fold increased risk.  The average age of the first thrombotic event is six years younger in individuals who are heterozygous for both factor V Leiden and the R2 polymorphism than in those with factor V Leiden alone.   1999 study concluded that heterozygotes for rs6025 and rs1799963 have an increased risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis after a first episode and are therefore candidates for lifelong anticoagulation treatment.

This SNP is in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of F5.  F5, also known as coagulation factor V (proaccelerin, lavile factor), encodes an essential cofactor of the blood coagulation cascade and defects in this gene have been known to result in either an autosomal recessive hemorrhagic diathesis or an autosomal dominant form of thrombophilia.  Recently, this SNP has been found to be associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE).  VTE, which can manifest itself as either deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common cardiovascular condition with a high mortality rate .  Annually, ~2 million adults develop DVT and approximately 600,000 PE hospitalizations and 60,000 deaths occur .  In a study done by Tang et al., a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted by first analyzing the top SNP associations for total incident VTE in CHARGE (cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology) and then the second-stage studies were performed using data from three case-control studies: the Mayo Clinic VTE Study, the MARseille Thrombosis Association VTE Study, and a French case-control study on early-onset VT.  In the CHARGE GWAS, 1,618 VTE cases were included from 44,499 participants, all of which were of European origin.  From that, the top 1,047 SNPs identified as having the greatest association were analyzed in 3,231 VTE cases and 3,536 controls.The initial CHARGE GWAS revealed that the rs6427196 G minor allele had a risk ratio (RR) of 1.82 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.58 to 2.10.  The p-value of this association was 1.97 x 10-16.  The second-stage analysis gave a RR of 2.31 with a 95% CI of 2.04 to 2.62 and a p-value of 2.56 x 10-38.  At this point, all the studies were combined to give an overall RR and p-value which indicated rs6427196 as the highest associated SNP with VTE.  The overall RR was 2.07 (95% CI = 1.89 &#8211; 2.28) and a p-value of 4.47 x 10-51.   linked to Cardiovascular EventsSeveral CVD risk variants were identified: In women, the combination of F5 rs7542281 &#195;&#8212; THBD rs1042580, together with three single F5 SNPs, was associated with CVD events.

Compared to the major (A;A) homozygote, the odds ratio was 1.7 (CI: 1 - 2.7) for (A;T) heterozygotes and 4.6 (CI: 2.6 - 8) for (T;T) minor allele homozygotes. In at least UK populations, and perhaps others, SNP rs2187668 is a tag SNP for the HLA-DRB1*0301 allele.The HLA-DRB1*0301 allele is the allele presenting the highest risk for developing lupus, and it appears to act in a dominant manner (i.e. inheriting 2 copies is no worse than inheriting 1 copy). In dbSNP orientation, the risk allele is rs2187668(A), with an odds ratio of 2.3x (CI: 1.7 - 3.2, permuted p < 0.0001).

The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 5.49 (CI 4.83-6.24), and for homozygotes (AA), the risk is 18.52 (CI 12.69-27.03). The P value is extremely significant at 5.47 × 10-134, considering the threshold for genome-wide significance. NOTE: In previous edits of this page, it has been noted that ""the (A) allele of rs9272346 is common in various human populations, and one could consider the (G) allele as protective."" However, the authors of  seem to disagree. (Of course, other significant genetic and/or environmental factors could be protecting the multitude of individuals with AG). In several other lines of their table, the allele identified as the risk allele is _not_ the minor allele. The authors are aware of the conventions for ODs for risk vs. protection, stating that risk allele ODs will be normally 1-2 and protective ODS are between 0.5-1 (Supplement 1, page 3). In light of this, if they wished to signify the G allele was protective, they would have given a protective allele odds-ratio in the range 0.5-1 to AG. Of course, any OD as large as 5.49 (for AG), much less 18.25 (for AA) is quite a significant risk factor compared to all other ODs on its table. Yet it cannot be a typographical error, since the rs9272346 OD of 5.49 and P values were replicated in their Supplement 1 page 43.  Their significant P values were confirmed to some degree in a 2015 study listed on this page. In this 2015 article titled ""Association of 32 type 1 diabetes risk loci in Pakistani patients,"" among 191 Pakistani cases and controls, the P value for rs9272346 was (p = 2.83E − 09).

hsa,PPARGC1A,"rs2290602 is a SNP in the PPARGC1A gene that has been associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A study of 200 Japanese adults indicated an odds ratio of 2.73 (CI: 1.48-5.06, corrected p = 0.014) for the rs2290602(T) allele. Association between PPARGC1A polymorphisms and the occurrence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  PGC-1alpha as modifier of onset age in Huntington disease. Localization of sequence variations in PGC-1alpha influence their modifying effect in Huntington disease.            Rs7665116 is located in an intronic region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1A gene, which codes for the protein PGC-1&#945;. The PGC-1 &#945; protein is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, thermogenesis, and molecular mechanisms responsible for cellular respiration.  PGC-1 &#945; has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington&#8217;s disease, as mutant huntingtin protein in HD patients inhibits the PGC-1&#945; system. The G polymorphism of the rs7665116 SNP has been associated with a three to five year delay in the age of onset of Huntington&#8217;s disease relative to the wildtype A allele.The rs7665116 SNP is located at the 3&#8217; end of intron 2 of PPARGC1A, in a highly conserved region of the gene. Though the majority of the variance in age of onset of Huntington&#8217;s disease is explained by the length of the CAG repeat in the HTT gene, a small portion of the variance (~4.3%) in age of onset is explained by rs7665116.  The CAG repeat length is causative of Huntington&#8217;s disease, One study conducted on a cohort of 854 European individuals (401 cases and 453 controls) revealed that the G variant of the rs76651116 SNP was associated with a delay in HD onset (p=0.0389 in the additive model and p=0.0112 in the dominant model). The association was particularly strong in the Italian population of participants, which comprised 312 of the 854 individuals (p=0.0172 in the additive model and p=0.0045 in the dominant model). For the rest of the population, the association was not statistically significant. Further studies will be necessary to determine significance in non-Italian populations.  Another study was conducted on a cohort of 400 German patients to determine various genetic modifiers of Huntington&#8217;s disease in order to create a multivariable model explaining the variance in age of onset of the disease. The transcriptional factors nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) regulate the are also implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis, and SNPs in these genes, along with rs7555116,  can explain 4.8% of the additional residual variance in the age of onset of the loss of motor coordination symptom of Huntington&#8217;s disease through a gene-gene interaction model.  The exact mechanism for these interactions remains unknown, and the experiment has yet to be replicated and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing in order to more clearly explain how NRF-1, TFAM, and PGC-1 &#945; interact to affect Huntington&#8217;s age of onset.  In general, this study underscores role of impaired mitochondrial function in the pathogenesis of Huntington&#8217;s, suggesting that upstream transcriptional factors of PCG1-1 &#945; may be useful targets for treating HD. One study conducted on a cohort of 234 (155 controls and 79 cases) Huntington&#8217;s patients of Italian descent demonstrated that the age of onset increased  depending on the genotype of rs7665116. For patients with an A/A genotype, age of onset was on average 45.08 years, while A/G patients were 48.75, and G/G patients began to show symptoms at age 49.09. Statistical significance was maintained after the application of the Bonferroni correction (p<0.02 for the additive model and p<0.005 for the dominant model).

A greatly extended PPARGC1A genomic locus encodes several new brain-specific isoforms and influences Huntington disease age of onset.  rs8192678 encodes a SNP also known as Gly482Ser; the (A) allele encodes the Ser. Some reports have linked this SNP to risk for hypertension and systolic blood pressure (SBP). However, a meta-analysis of 13,000+ individuals did not find any such association. However, gene-age interaction was apparent. For diastolic blood pressure (DBP), p(interaction)<0.0001; for systolic BP, p(interaction)=0.026. In younger individuals (<50yrs; n=2511) the rs8192678(A) allele was associated with higher DBP (p=4.2 x 10<sup>-12</sup>) and SBP (p=7.2 x 10<sup>-12</sup>), but no association was evident for individuals over 50yrs (n=5088).

This SNP does not yet appear to be common in consumer tests. a variation in CYP2D6    Also known as c.100C>T (p.Pro34Ser or P34S), the wild type (normal) allele at this SNP is (C). The (T) variant indicates the presence of a non-wild type CYP2D6 variant, but it appears in many different variants so it can not be used to determine the presence of any particular variant. The most common variants it appears in are CYP2D6*10 and CYP2D6*4, but these are not the only ones. While this is the defining mutation for CYP2D6*10, it is not possible by itself for this mutation to determine a particular variant. In addition, the CYP2D6*4 variant includes this mutation, but the defining mutation 1846G>A SNP is not available in the common direct to consumer testing services.While it is not possible for this mutation to identify one particular variant, all the variants in which it appears have reduced or no CYP2D6 activity.If two copies of this (or similar) changes are inherited, poor metabolism ('PM') of debrisoquine  is observed. Other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 include dextromorphan, sparteine, nortriptyline, atomoxetine , and codeine.Nakamura et al  suggest that thermal instabilities and reduced intrinsic clearance by the protein encoded by the rs1065852(T) allele are the main reasons Asians show lower metabolic activities than Caucasians for drugs metabolized mainly by CYP2D6, since this (T) allele occurs in higher frequency in Asians.A study of several hundred Chinese breast cancer patients treated with either tamoxifen or toremifene reported that for the 50 women who were CYP2D6*10 homozygotes (i.e. rs1065852(T;T)), the group treated with toremifene had a significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate than the group treated with tamoxifen (90.9% vs. 67.9%, p = 0.031). For the remaining rs1065852 (C;C) and (C;T) patients, there was no significant difference between the 5-year DFS rates of those treated with one drug versus the other.It is also suggested that poor metabolizers of debrisoquine will be poor metabolizers of metoprolol, diltiazem (brand name cardizem), and propafenone.

The (A) form disrupts proper mRNA formation, resulting in a nonfunctional CYP2D6 protein. The associated allele is also known as CYP2D6*4. The CYP2D6*4 allele is the most common nonfunctioning variant of CYP2D6.If two copies of this (or similar) changes are inherited, poor metabolism ('PM') of debrisoquine  is observed. Many other drugs are typically first metabolized by CYP2D6 including dextromorphan, sparteine, metoprolol, nortriptyline and many other antidepressants and codeine. Of course, sometimes the active form of a drug is the one post-CYP2D6 metabolism; an example of this is tamoxifen, where the active form (endoxifen) is formed primarily via CYP2D6 metabolism; less functioning CYP2D6 can mean less benefit from taking the drug.The CYP2D6*4 allele (i.e. rs3892097(A)) has been postulated by researchers over the years to have many potential consequences, both positive and negative.On the positive side: this allele may reduce the risk of certain cancers, such as bladder and lung , and it may correlate with somwhat less severe neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's .On the other hand, at least two studies PMID 14991823, PMID 15174030 have concluded that the risk of developing Parkinson's disease upon exposure to pesticides is increased from 3 to 8 fold among carriers of CYP2D6*4 alleles. The risk to CYP2D6*4 carriers appears proportional to the degree of pesticide exposure, with no additional risk of developing Parkinson's seen for CYP2D6*4 carriers with no pesticide exposure, and the highest increased risk of developing Parkinson's seen for CYP2D6*4 carriers with frequent exposure to pesticides.Patients prescribed tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) who are homozygous for the CYP2D6*4 allele metabolize these drugs more slowly, which puts them at higher risk for adverse side effects. A study of ~1100 Dutch patients reports: (1) 6 fold more side effects upon switching antidepressants for CYP2D6*4 homozygotes, but not for heterozygotes, and (2) that the effective and maintenance doses of antidepressants for CYP2D6*4 homozygotes are lower than for patients with one or more higher metabolizing CYP2D6 alleles. rs3892097(A;A) patients taking a beta blocker drug such as metoprolol are at ~4x increased risk for bradycardia, based on a study of 1,533 patients in the Rotterdam Study. These CYP2D6 *4/*4 homozygotes have the 'poor metabolizer' (PM) phenotypes, and had adjusted heart rates that were 8.5 beats/min lower compared with *1/*1 extensive metabolizers (EMs) (p < 0.001), leading to an increased risk of bradycardia in PMs (odds ratio of 3.86, CI: 1.68-8.86,  p = 0.0014). a variation in CYP2D6 a variation in CYP2D6 a variation in CYP2D6  a variation in CYP2D6 a variation in CYP2D6 a variation in CYP2D6 a variation in CYP2D6 The (-) form of this SNP, representing a deletion of one nucleotide, causes a frameshift such that the resulting CYP2D6 protein is nonfunctional. The associated allele is also known as CYP2D6*6, and there are several subtypes but they are all nonfunctional.If two copies of this (or similar) changes are inherited, CYP2D6 poor metabolism ('PM') is observed. CYP2D6 poor metabolism may affect the efficacy or degree of side effects of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, such as dextromorphan, sparteine, nortriptyline, venlafaxine and codeine.

hsa,HLA-DRB1,"In at least UK populations, and perhaps others, SNP rs2187668 is a tag SNP for the HLA-DRB1*0301 allele.The HLA-DRB1*0301 allele is the allele presenting the highest risk for developing lupus, and it appears to act in a dominant manner (i.e. inheriting 2 copies is no worse than inheriting 1 copy). In dbSNP orientation, the risk allele is rs2187668(A), with an odds ratio of 2.3x (CI: 1.7 - 3.2, permuted p < 0.0001). From individuals with the most common rs2187668(G;G) genotype, risk is reduced for celiac disease, with an odds ratio of 0.30x according to a study of ~800 patients.rs2187668(A) also tags the tightly linked DQB1*0201 allele, which in turn is linked to DQA1*0501; together, these are known as the DQ2.5 haplotype.

The risk per allele (or per haplotype) appears additive.  It has also been associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) ( see) and, when linked with DQB1*0602, narcolepsy. The HLA-DRB1*1501 allele is fairly common; for example, it occurs in 15-30% of individuals of Northern European ancestry. Note: most publications refer to the risk allele as rs3135388(A), but in dbSNP and SNPedia orientation, it is rs3135388(T).An interesting series of correlations have been woven together to suggest that a possible way to lower the risk of rs3135388(T) carriers developing multiple sclerosis would be to ensure sufficient vitamin D production, presumably through sunlight exposure, during as yet unknown critical periods in development.  Association between rs3135388(T) allele and multiple sclerosis also seen in 269 Serbian patients, with an odds ratio of 2 for (T) allele carriers.

However, it appears as if the D444H mutation results in 48% of normal enzyme activity, and if found in combination with a BTD gene mutation associated with profound deficiency, may result in partial biotinidase deficiency.Note that this condition is treatable; children with biotinidase deficiency identified early enough should remain asymptomatic if biotin therapy is instituted early.

Telomere shortening can lead to premature aging, in terms of increased risk for age-associated diseases such as heart disease, and at least some forms of cancer, and therefore also reduced longevity.Note that all individuals in this study were of European descent, so it is unknown if this finding will hold across different ethnicities.

Carriers of this allele appear to have reduced serotonin synthesis, which may result in increased susceptibility to ADHD and possibly other psychiatric disorders.     rs1386494 is a SNP in the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) gene on chromosome 12.  It is located about 20,000 bp from the 5' end of the gene.   This SNP has been found to be associated with various mental health disorders.  TPH1 and TPH2 are two isoforms of the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of 5-HT (serotonin), a neurotransmitter involved in many neurological processes.  Both isoforms have been studied extensively as genetic markers of mental health.  Many association studies have linked the TPH1 gene to suicidality, alcoholism and depression.   However, the second TPH isoform was not discovered until more recently, when it was observed that TPH1 knockout mice were still able to produce normal levels of 5-HT.    It has been shown to be expressed exclusively in the brain, suggesting that it could play a major role in psychiatric disorders. The association between the SNP rs1386494 and major depression (MD) was first reported in a study of a cohort of 300 Caucasian patients with MD.  rs1386494 was found to be the most significantly associated of all 10 SNPs studied, with a p-value of 0.0012.   Another study of the association between the TPH2 gene and depression was conducted in a Finnish population of 119 patients who showed treatment risistance.  The researchers showed that A/A depression patients had significantly more severe depression, as measured by the Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), (p < 0.001) but showed a greater decline in MADRS score as a result of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment (p = 0.03).    Several other studies have confirmed the association of this SNP and linked SNPS with major depression. Similarly, rs1386494 has been linked to suicide attempts.  In a case study of 263 individuals who committed suicide and matched control patients, SNP, haplotype and LD studies support association between the TPH2 SNP and completed suicide.   However, a study of 150 alcohol-dependent patients reported no significant association with alcohol-related suicide behavior.   Both studies were conducted in Caucasian populations.More recently, studies have linked rs1386494 with schizophrenia in Asian populations.  In a case-control study of 289 Malaysians, the G allele was found to be enriched in schizophrenic patients.  Due to the low occurrence of suicidality in the study population, the authors rule out the role of suicidal behavior in this association, supporting a more direct neurological role of this SNP.  In a study of TPH2 SNPs in panic disorder, rs1386494 was found to have a gender-specific effect, where the association was seen only the female subgroup.

P21(waf1/cip1) gene polymorphisms and possible interaction with cigarette smoking in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in northeastern Iran: a preliminary study. rs1801270 is a SNP known as p21 codon 31, although the gene now known to code for the p21 protein is termed CDKN1A, and has also been known as WAF1 and CIP1. Along with p53 codon 72 (rs1042522), it is one of the best studied SNPs due to its role in increased tumor susceptibility (and thus cancer). A study of ~150 lung cancer patients in Sweden found that the rs1801279(A) allele, encoding the amino acid Arg at codon 31, represented the risk allele (odds ratio 1.7, CI: 1.0-2.9), compared to healthy individuals. The difference was even more striking when compared to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in which case the odds ratio was over 5.

This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers. These risks include:* An increased risk for breast cancer is reported in premenopausal African-American women, based on a study of 200 women. The reported odds ratio was 1.8 (CI: 1.0-3.1, p=0.06) for carriers of one or more UGT1A1*28 alleles.* In colorectal cancer patients being treated with irinotecan, adverse side effects (neutropenia and/or severe diarrhea) are reported to be strongly associated with the number of UGT1A1*28 alleles.

An IL-6 haplotype on human chromosome 7p21 confers risk for impaired renal function in type 2 diabetic patients. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and prostate cancer risk in men aged 65 years and older. Association of genetic variation in serum amyloid-A with cardiovascular disease and interactions with IL6, IL1RN, IL1beta and TNF genes in the Cardiovascular Health Study.  rs1800795 is a SNP in the promoter of the interleukin-6 IL6 gene, affecting the levels made of this important cytokine. In the literature, it is almost universally referred to as the IL6 ""-174"" polymorphism. It tends to be quite polymorphic in Caucasians, but Asian and African populations are almost monomorphic (for the (G) allele).It was first described in 1998, when it was shown that the rs1800795(C) allele produces less IL6 than the (G) allele, which supported the hypothesis that a protective genotype against systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis would be rs1800795(C;C), and indeed, few juvenile RA patients had that genotype.Studies on rs1800795 now include potential associations with heart disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, type-2 diabetes, stroke, obesity, Hodgkin's lymphoma, sudden infant death syndrome, cancer (including breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer), hypertension, periodontitis, and complications arising after organ transplantations or grafts. It is worth noting that some of the associations seen for rs1800795 alleles are not for the risk of developing a given disorder; instead, they relate to how a disorder might progress or respond to various treatments. Summaries of several major associations are available at  OMIM.The rs1800795(G) allele, generally associated with higher levels of IL6, has been associated with increased risk in the following studies:* The rs1800795(G) allele was significantly associated with type-2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.51, CI: 1.11-2.07, p=0.0096) in a study of 700 elderly Caucasians.* Following a kidney transplant, patients with rs1800795(G;G) genotypes have a higher risk of new-onset diabetes and higher C-reactive protein levels) compared to the (C;C) genotype. Since this was more pronounced in overweight patients, the authors suggest that diabetes-inducing drug administration should be limited in overweight patients who are rs1800795(G;G) following renal transplantation.* The development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after lung transplantation is more likely and happens earlier for rs1800795(G) carriers.* Among HIV+ men, the lifetime risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma is higher for rs1800795(G;G) homozygotes compared to (C;C) homozygotes.* Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma who are rs1800795(G;G) were less likely to be successfully treated, with odds ratios for failure of 1.75 (CI: 1.04-2.92, p=0.03).* A study of 139 elderly males with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) indicated that rs1800795(G;G) genotypes were at 3.89 fold (CI: 1.71-8.86, p=0.001) higher risk of dying within one year of their ACS event than (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes.* Although the odds of having a stroke weren't different, among patients (in this case, under 60 years of age) who did have a stroke those with a rs1800795(G;G) genotype had more severe disability after 1 week (odds ratio 3.2, CI: 1.5-6.6, p=0.002).* Among Chinese patients with hypertension, the rs1800795(G) allele is more common, and (G;G) genotypes had significantly higher plasma PAI-1 activity than (C;C) genotypes.* In 168 Brazilian patients, rs1800795(G) allele frequency was higher in gastric cancer than in patients with chronic gastritis. * Although the odds of having Crohn's disease aren't affected, among 153 children with it, those with the rs1800795(G;G) genotype were more growth-retarded at diagnosis than (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes. (G;G) patients also had higher circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). * rs1800795(G) carriers don't increase their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels after 24 weeks of aerobic exercise as much as rs1800795(C) carriers.* The rs1800795(G;G) genotype was more frequent in Australian infants with sudden infant death syndrome (58%) than in control subjects (38%, p=0.02). This was not seen in a Norwegian population.* Women with endometriosis who are rs1800795(G) carriers appear to be more likely to develop chocolate cysts, and (G) allele carriers may be at slightly higher risk of developing endometriosis.* The rs1800795(G) allele is more frequent in women with hyperandrogenism than in controls.* Children with the rs1800795(G;G) genotype are more likely to have recurrent acute otitis, based on a study of 348 patients, with an odds ratio of 1.64 (p=0.02). * (G) allele is increased risk ((C) allele is decreased risk) for type-2 diabetes; this SNP is one of 4 relatively common SNPs reported to represent risk for type-2 diabetes in the DESIR prospective study of 3,877 Caucasian participants. Under an additive model, the odds ratio for rs1800795(C) carriers is 0.79 (CI: 0.65-0.96, p=0.01). For the 4 SNPs, each risk allele increased type-2 diabetes risk by 1.34x (p=2x10e-6), with an odds ratio of 2.48 (CI: 1.59-3.86) for carriers of 4 or more compared to those with one or none (risk alleles).The rs1800795(C) allele, generally associated with lower levels of IL6, has been associated with increased risk in these studies:* rs1800795 (C;C) and (C;G) Caucasians who are excessively heavy (body mass index ~33 +/- 5kg/m2) are at increased risk (odds ratio 5.2, p=0.003) for developing obesity-related metabolic disorders such as hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.* Among 571 patients with type-2 diabetes, the rs1800795(C) allele is correlated with higher body mass index, but it showed no correlation among non-diabetics.* A study of 238 Caucasians with type-2 diabetes concluded that rs1800795(C) carriers have an insulin resistance ""IL-6-sensitive"" phenotype and perhaps strategies to manage insulin resistance should be different between (C) carriers vs. (G;G) patients.* In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) being treated by hemodialysis, rs1800795(C) allele carriers had higher diastolic blood pressure (p=0.008) and a higher left ventricular mass index (p=0.026) than (G;G) homozygotes. Among diabetic patients in dialysis, the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in (C) allele carriers was 87.5% vs. 36.3% among (G;G) genotypes (p= 0.02).* Among recipient of a kidney transplant, rs1800795(C) allele carriers had worse three-year graft survival (71/104 = 68.3%; p=0.0059) with a 3.7-fold increased relative risk of graft loss compared to rs1800795(G;G) genotypes (48/54 = 88.9%). The authors suggest that determining the rs1800795 genotype may offer a new method for identifying patients at increased risk of allograft loss.* Among prostate cancer patients, the rs1800795(C) allele is associated with more aggressive cancer and higher prostate-specific antigen levels compared to rs1800795(G;G) homozygotes.* Although the rs1800795(C) allele was not associated with a higher frequency of heart attacks, it did have an association with inflammation and infarcts detectable only by MRI, suggesting that rs1800795(C) may chronically predispose an individual to develop atherosclerosis.* The combination of carrying at least one rs1800795(C) and one rs1205(T), a SNP in the C-reactive protein gene, led to higher risk of a stroke after cardiac surgery (odds ratio 3.3, CI: 1.4-8.1, p=0.0023) compared to individuals who were rs1800795(G;G) and rs1205(C;C).* The rs1800795(C) allele was associated with higher postoperative IL6 levels and a less favorable clinical outcome following coronary revascularization surgery.* The rs1800795(C;C) genotype was significantly higher in the group of 122 adult periodontitis patients than in controls (odds ratio 1.896, CI: 1.1-3.2, p=0.0283).* The degree of periodontitis was more severe in rs1800795(C) carriers than (G) carriers.* The rs1800795(C) allele was over-represented in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls and the (C;C) genotype was associated with higher risk in women.* The rs1800795(C) allele was higher in non-survivors compared to (nonagenarian) survivors in a case/control study of ~100 pairs of matched Finnish individuals; to put it another way, the rs1800795(G) allele may be associated with increased longevity. rs1800797, rs1800796 and rs1800795 have been shown to affect both the transcription and secretion of IL-6, to symptomatic distal interphalangeal osteoarthritis based on 535 women. the G alleles of two promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) G-597A and G-174C were more common among the subjects with symptomatic DIP OA than among those with no disease (p-values corrected for multiple testing 0.020 and 0.024). Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001). Carriage of the G-G diplotype indicated an increased risk of both symmetrical DIP OA (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28) and symptomatic DIP OA (OR 3.67 95% CI 1.50 to 9.00) Suggests that ""healthy elderly individuals may have a proinflammatory profile playing as a downregulating factor for inducible Hsp70, particularly if -174 G/C-negative"" and that therefore, a nutraceutical intervention (fermented papaya preparation 9 g/day) might be of benefit. rs1800795 coronary artery disease 190 affected Asian Indian sibling pairs  rs1800796 IL-6 572G>C polymorphism (and h.211 haplotype) is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

hsa,GDF5,"This SNP is associated with osteoarthritis (OA). It is located in the ''five prime untranslated region'' (| '''5&#8242;UTR''') of the gene encoding ''growth differentiation factor 5'' (| '''GDF5'''), a chondrogenic protein active from the embryonic stage onwards. GDF5 is also known as ''cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein 1'' or ''BMP14''. The '''risk allele T''' (+ 104T/C;rs143383) causes reduction of the GDF5 promoter sequence activity. Reduction of GDF5 in human cartilage of patients with OA by up to 27% has been observed . This effect is '''influenced by a second SNP ( rs143384 , C/T )''' in the same area. The C alleles of both SNPs form CpG dinucleotides. Demethylation of both SNP's increases GDF5 expression.  Thus the authors conclude that epigenetic manipulation offers options in developing therapies for OA. rs143383 showed significant association with hip osteoarthritis in two independent Japanese populations. It also showed association with knee osteoarthritis in Japanese and Chinese populations. is *not* a risk factor for osteoarthritis in Greek CaucasiansA subsequent study showed that the same risk allele, rs143383(T), was (somewhat) associated with osteoarthritis in European populations. The odds ratio was 1.10 for the allele, 1.28 for carrier status (p=0.03, p=0.004, respectively). The (T) allele appears to make less GDF5 protein, which eventually renders an individual somewhat more susceptible to osteoarthritis.A meta-analysis combining data from 11,000+ individuals as well as both European and Asian populations found strong evidence (p < 0.0004) confirming increased risk for osteoarthritis from the rs143383(T) allele. The best model is a dominant one, and the odds ratio reported is 1.21 in general and 1.48 for the dominant model.Another meta-analysis of 14 studies concluded that rs143383 did indeed show significant association with osteoarthritis, at least for knee osteoarthritis, and probably for hand and hip (but to a lesser degree). The effect size wasn't large, though (odds ratio 1.15, CI: 1.09-1.22, p = 9.4 x 10e-7).A haplotype of rs143383 and rs6060369 can be defined, which also links osteoarthritis to height since rs6060369 was linked to height in a study ultimately involving over 28,000 individuals.The  Medpage article on this finding notes that rs143383 was previously shown to be associated with increased risk for osteoarthritis and in this recent study  it was significantly associated with shorter height in the initial scans, at p=2.70x10e-5.Note that the authors of  refer to rs143383 in the opposite orientation compared to it's entry in dbSNP.  A study of 338 Han Chinese children affected by congenital dysplasia of the hip revealed that rs143383(T) alleles conferred a 1.4x increased risk for the disorder, particularly in females (odds ratio 1.43, CI: 1.11 - 1.85, p = 0.0078).

A study of 442 healthy, once-a-month cannabis users between the ages of 16-23 to see if AKT1 variants influenced acute psychosis response concluded that the number of rs2494732(C) alleles predicted (p = 0.015) acute (i.e. temporary) psychotic response to cannabis. Basically, the more copies someone had of this SNP, the more likely they were to have mind-altering symptoms while stoned. Other factors studied, including gender, ethnicity, and years of cannabis use, did not predict whether they would have these (transient) symptoms. Note that this side-effect (psychosis or paranoia) was infrequent in an absolute sense regardless of genotype. A case-control study of 489 first-episode psychosis patients concluded that while rs2494732 was not associated with an increased risk of a psychotic disorder, with lifetime cannabis use, or with frequency of use, there was a significant association between psychosis and cannabis use. rs2494732(C;C) individuals with a history of cannabis use had an increased likelihood of a psychotic disorder (odds ratio 2.18, CI: 1.1 - 4.3) when compared with users who were (T;T) carriers. The interaction between the rs2494732 genotype and frequency of use was also somewhat significant (likelihood ratio = 13.39; p = .010). Among daily users, (C;C) carriers had a 7x increase in the odds of psychosis compared with (T;T) carriers (odds ratio 7.23, CI: 1.37 - 38.12). among (likely Japanese) 120 first-episode neuroleptic-naive schizophrenics treated with risperidone genotyped for 30 variants in misc. dopamine and serotonin (receptors and otherwise) two SNPs in DRD2 (rs1799989 and rs1800497) and two SNPs in AKT1 (rs3803300 and rs2494732) were significant predictors of treatment response to risperidoneThe ancestral allele is C in the  dbSNP database.

In mice, the genetic locus best correlated to anxiety-related behaviour contains the 'regulator of G protein signaling 2' gene . In humans, SNPs in the equivalent RGS2 gene have now been studied to see if they are correlated to anxiety related disorders.In the first part of one study, 119 families including children underwent standard lab-based behavioural assessments of behavioural inhibition, defined as a heritable temperamental profile characterized by a tendency to be shy, avoident, and behaviourally restrained in situations that are novel or unfamiliar. Along with some other RGS2 SNPs, carriers of a rs4606(G) allele were 3 fold more likely to exhibit behavioural inhibition (CI: 1.31-6.84, p = 0.0026).In the second part of this study, 744 college undergraduates (228 men, 516 women) who had been genotyped completed a personality profile known as the NEO-E (introversion) association test. Consistent with the earlier results, the same RGS2 alleles associated with behavioural inhibition were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with introversion (but not neuroticism), including rs4606(G), rs6428136(G), and rs10801152(T).In the third part of this study, 55 female undergraduates were studied by fMRI (functional MRI) emotional processing tests. Carriers of SNPs rs4606(G) or rs10801152(T) showed increased insular cortex activation, a reflection of anxiety, in these tests.Based on these results, the authors predict that social anxiety disorder is the most likely anxiety disorder to be associated with SNPs in the RGS2 gene such as rs4606.   SNPs in the RGS2 gene, including rs4606, show association with childhood temperament, adult personality, and brain function. each rs4606(C) allele was associated with a 2x (p =.026) increased risk of generalized anxiety disorder. 173 patients with panic disorder (and 173 matched controls) of German descent analyzed, leading to the conclusion that rs4606(G) carriers were at ~2x increased risk for this disorder.

Another variant, rs41293455(G), encodes a Gly (aka c.4327C>G or p.Arg1443Gly); this variant appears to be benign by consensus in ClinVar.A well known study published in 1994 looked at 50 family pedigrees with breast cancer and ovarian cancer susceptibility, discovering what they believed were eight putative disease-causing mutations (four frameshifts, two nonsense mutations) and an additional two missense mutations. rs41293455 was one of these variants. * See also  Omim 113705.0016* See also  Omim 113705.0017 rs41293463, also known as c.5324T>G (p.Met1775Arg or M1775R) as well as c.5324T>A (p.Met1775Lys or M1775K), is a SNP causing an amino acid change in the breast cancer 1 BRCA1 gene at amino position 1775.A study found that the rs41293463(G) allele has impaired transcriptional ability, and this allele was found in some patients with breast cancer.

For V1736A, there is now a publication studying the change in depth and concluding it does predispose carriers to breast cancer.,The evidence indicating V1736G is pathogenic appears to primarily be computational (i.e. predictive, such as ) and should be treated with caution. There are breast cancer patients harboring the BRCA1 V1736G mutation, but to our knowledge, to date there is no pedigree or other direct evidence confirming pathogenicity. This SNP, a variant in the BRCA1 gene, is 1 of 25 SNPs reported to represent independently minor, but cumulatively significant, increased risk for breast cancer.

Furthermore, 99% of Ancestry raw data reports rs111033566 as being (T;T).

However, the frequency of the minor allele is relatively high (~3% in ExAC), and, OMIM quotes a paper that concludes this N54S variant is itself functional, but due to gene conversion with a pseudogene it may be seen together with an actual pathogenic mutation nearby, rs111033566.       aka c.47C>T, p.Ala16Val and A16V   aka c.346C>T, p.Arg116Cys and R116C aka c.116T>C, p.Val39Ala and V39A aka c.415T>A, p.Cys139Ser and C139S aka c.63_71dupTGACAAGAT (p.Ile24_Val25insAspLysIle) c.65A>G, p.Asp22Gly and D22G",,,SNPedia

hsa,CACNB2,"/ 23andMe blog blood pressure        Association between rs2799573 and psychiatric disorders was shown in a 2013 study by the Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium . In this study, genome-wide SNP data consisting of 1,250,922 autosomal SNPs were analyzed to identify genetic variants associated with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. 33,332 cases and 27,888 controls included both unrelated and family-based samples (trios). A multinomial logistic regression procedure was used to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. This SNP, on chromosome 10 in an intron of CACNB2, was one of four genome-wide significant signals associated with the five psychiatric disorders (p = 4.29 x 10-8). The risk allele T exhibited allele frequency of 0.715 in controls. CACNB2 encodes a voltage-gated calcium-channel subunit that interacts with other calcium-channel subunits to facilitate their function and increase peak calcium current. Although CACNB2 had not been previously identified as a risk gene for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, its interactor CACNA1C, was known to be a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder , schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder . Effects of CACNA1C variants on emotion processing circuitry, attention, and memory were demonstrated in fMRI studies . Consistent with this, one of the four significant signals from the 2013 study lies within an intron of CACNA1C. Other peaks identified in this study were rs2535629 and rs11191454.In addition, a variant within CACNB2 52 kb away from rs2799573 was one of the most significant signals in an independent GWAS of bipolar disorder in Han Chinese.

Compared with individuals not taking statins, the unadjusted odds ratio of colorectal cancer among rs12654264(A;A) statin users was 0.3 (CI: 0.18-0.51) and among rs12654264(T;T) statin users, 0.66 (CI: 0.41-1.06, p-interaction 0.0012).Their data may advance the development of personalized statin use for reducing the risk of cancer as well as cardiovascular disease among the approximately 25 million people currently using statins worldwide.  additional allele of rs17238484(G) was associated with a mean 0.06-mmol/L lower LDL-cholesterol level.

In addition, they found that each additional allele of rs17238484-G was associated with a higher body weight (0.30 kg), waist circumference (0.32 cm), and plasma insulin concentration (1.62%) and plasma glucose concentration (0.23%).

The protein encoded by this gene is the target for drugs designed to inhibit its action, in order to lower cholesterol levels. SNPs in the HMGCR gene may affect how well such drugs (typically statins) work.In a study of ~1,500 patients treated with 40mg/d of pravastatin, rs17238540(G;T) heterozgyotes had a mean decrease in total cholesterol of 32.5 mg/dL (0.85 mmol/L), while the mean change for rs17238540(T;T) homozygotes was 41.8 mg/dL (1.09 mmol/L), a reduction in overall efficacy of 22.3% (absolute difference, 9.3 mg/dL, CI: 3.8-14.7 mg/dL, p<.001). The drop in total cholesterol was almost completely due to the decrease in LDL cholesterol, as there was no significant difference in the change in HDL cholesterol with pravastatin between genotypes.A separate study of 1,000 Scottish individuals taking statins found that 28% of rs17238540(T;T) individuals failed to reach target compared with 51% of the individuals carrying a (G) allele, yielding an adjusted odds ratio for failure of 2.93 (CI: 1.61-5.34) mmol/l, p=0.0005. Additionally, they found that heterozygotes had a 13% smaller reduction in total cholesterol (-32.3 vs. -37.1%, p=0.0081) and a 27% smaller reduction in triglycerides (-27.5 vs. -37.6%, p=0.0046), leading to their conclusion that rs17238540(G;T) heterozygotes may respond less well to statin therapy in terms of lowered total cholesterol and triglycerides.

This SNP has made the news based on a (single) study reporting that carriers of an rs1129844(A) allele might have delayed onset of Alzheimer's disease compared to individuals lacking an (A) allele. An analysis of 72 whole genome scans of selected Colombian PSEN1 E280A carriers, i.e. rs63750231(A;C) genotypes, all of whom have '''early-onset''' Alzheimer's, found that a protective haplotype delayed Alzheimer disease onset by up to 10 years. The only coding SNP in this protective haplotype associated with delayed AD onset was rs1129844. A follow-on study in 152 Alzheimer patients in a UCSF cohort (average onset age 63 years, which is considered late-onset and is the more common type of Alzheimer's) did not find a statistically significant protective effect for the rs1129844(A) allele, but did observe a ""trend"" towards protection in the data.

Since it is located on the X chromosome, males will be hemizygous and either (C;-) or (G;-), whereas females will either homozygous (C;C) or (G;G) or heterozygous (C;G). In most of the studies cited below, heterozyous (C;G) females were roughly statistically equivalent to females carrying the common non-risk (G;G) genotype.One relatively large (4,000 men and 2,000 women) study published in late 2013 of Caucasian catheterization patients has studied the association between rs6318 genotype and risk of having an ""end"" cardiac event, defined as either death or a heart attack, in the years following entry into the study (i.e. presumably following their catheterization). Patients were followed for up to 11 years, with a median follow-up time of 5.3 years. Different rs6318 genotypes had statistically significant differences in their odds of having end cardiac events as follows: 29% of (G;-) men; 35% of (C;-) men; ~26% of (G;G) or (C;G) women; and 36% of (C;C) women. This works out to hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model for male rs6318(C;-) compared to the more common (G;-) males of 1.23 (CI: 1.02-1.36, p=0.02), and 1.62 (CI:1.07-2.47, p=0.02) for female (C;C) genotypes compared to the more common (G;G) females. The authors postulate that rs6318 is associated with higher stress-related cortisol levels, and suggest (without any evidence so far) that rs6318(C;C) women and (C;-) men may benefit from either behavioural therapy or the use of a serotonin receptor antagonist such as agomelatine.

Two other nearby SNPs, rs41380347 ""T/G(-13915)"" and rs41525747 ""C/G(-13907)"", are also associated to a lesser degree. PMID 17159977, PMID 23029545 Also known as ""G/A(-22018)"" and located in the MCM6 but with influence on the lactase LCT gene, rs182549 is one of two SNPs that is associated with the primary haplotype associated with hypolactasia, more commonly known as lactose intolerance in European Caucasian populations. PMID 11788828, PMID 15114531In these populations, the rs182549(C) allele (as named in accordance with dbSNP) is both the more common allele and the one associated with lactose intolerance.In populations of sub-Saharan Africans, though, the rs182549(C) allele is unlikely to be predictive of lactose intolerance, and other SNPs are predictive instead.

Also known as ""C/T(-13915)"", and located in the MCM6 gene but with influence on the lactase LCT gene, rs4988235 is one of several SNPs that is associated with the primary haplotype associated with hypolactasia, more commonly known as lactose intolerance in Arab Bedouin populations. In Arabia, lactase persistence (LP) is associated with tion -13,915*G and not, as in Europe, with -13,910*T or, as in Africa, with -13,907*G and -14,010*C. We show here that, in Arabia, -13,915*G frequency conforms to a partial clinal pattern and that this specific mutation has likely been spread from Arabia to Africa only recently from the sixth century AD onward by nomadic Arabs (Bedouins) looking for new pastures. Arabic populations in Africa that still maintain a nomadic way of life also have more -13,915*G variants and fewer sub-Saharan L-type mitochondrial DNA haplogroups; this observation matches archaeological and historical records suggesting that the migration of Arabic pastoralists was accompanied by gradual sedentarization that allowed for admixture with the local African population.

It is therefore likely the heterozygotes may also experience symptoms of lactose intolerance at times (depending on age and amount of lactose).In populations of sub-Saharan Africans, though, the rs4988235(T) allele is so rare that it's unlikely to be predictive of lactase persistence, and other SNPs are predictive instead.

After adjusting for age, sex, race, etiology, and severity of cirrhosis the number of (G) copies led to an odds ratio for either (G;G) or (A;G) genotypes versus the (A;A) genotype of 3.49 (CI: 1.29-9.44, p=.01). In another study, analysis of 197 glioma patients showed that the rs4444903(G) allele conferred higher risks for gliomas (odds ratio 1.32, CI: 1.04-1.67), glioblastomas (OR, 1.47, CI: 1.02-2.10), and oligodendrogliomas (OR, 1.55, CI: 1.07-2.23). In general, the risk was about the same for a carrier or one or two (G) alleles, however, no significant association was observed with patients' overall survival.A study of 126 Indian gallbladder cancer patients concluded that the rs4444903(G;G) genotype was at increased risk, but only in females (odds ratio 3.45, CI: 1.52-7.82, p = 0.003).effects lots of no known riskpmids15373782 15729146 16214932 16214933 16214934 16214935 16217151 16217152 16217153 rs4444903, rs2298991, rs7692976 and rs4533485 significantly interacted with gender for acute respiratory distress syndrome  risk.popular in pubmed Epidermal growth factor gene polymorphism is different between schizophrenia and lung cancer patients in Korean population.

This SNP has been linked to a wide variety of conditions:* Allograft rejection** Among 72 Polish patients receiving a kidney transplant, the risk of acute kidney allograft rejection was 2.5x higher among rs1800629(A) carriers compared to (G;G) homozygotes (CI: 1.19- 5.37, p<.05). * Asthma** A meta-analysis of ~2,500 patients combined indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele was associated with a 1.46x increased risk for asthma. ** In a study of ~600 Mexican families and their asthmatic children, rs1800629(A) carriers had an increased risk of asthma (relative risk = 1.54, CI: 1.04-2.28), especially among children of non-smoking parents (odds then 2.06, CI: 1.19-3.55, p for interaction = 0.09). ** In a study of Norwegian children, nonallergic asthma was associated with rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio 1.7, CI: 1.3-2.3). * Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease** A meta-analysis of 36 publications totaling ~5,000 patients concluded that the association between the rs1800629(A) allele and the risk of COPD was statistically significant for Asians (odds ratio 2.36, CI: 1.84 - 3.02, p < 0.0001) but not for Caucasians.* Crohn's disease** In a study of 235 Portuguese patients, the rs1800629(A;A) genotype was associated with higher susceptibility to Crohn's disease, with an odds ratio of 3.0 (CI: 1.2-7.2). These homozygotes also showed more disease-related complications. * Exfoliation glaucoma (XFG)** A study of 204 patients with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) concluded that rs1800629 is unlikely to be a major risk factor for XFG in Caucasians. * Graves' disease** A meta-analysis of 10 case-control studies, including over 2,200 Graves' disease cases, concluded that rs1800629(A) carriers were associated with this type of hyperthyroidism. * Heart disease** A study of 600 Italian patients concluded that rs1800629(A) carriers are at increased risk for acute heart attack and have other markers of heart disease. The odd ratio was 1.86, CI: 1.08-3.21, p=0.027). ** A study of 50 Egyptian children with rheumatic heart disease found increased risk associated with the rs1800629(A;A) homozygotes, with odds ratio = 5.7, p<0.001. However, there was a significantly lower frequency of heterozygous genotypes.  ** However, a 2016 meta-analysis including 12 publications consisting of 6000+ cases found no significant association between rs1800629 and risk for myocardial infarction.* Ischemic stroke** A meta-analysis of 18 studies with 8075 patients found no significant association between ischemic stroke and the TNFα-308G/A, except potentially in a subgroup of East Asians.* Leprosy** A study of 37 Thai patients with leprosy found that the rs1800629(A) allele was more common (odds ratio = 2.69, p=0.04). PMID 17624216}* Liver disease** A study of 108 Chinese patients concludes that rs1800629(A) carriers are at 3.23x (CI: 1.10-9.44) increased risk for liver cancer and are also at higher risk for hepatic fibrosis and more severe liver damage.  * Lymphoma** A study of 194 Tunisian patients indicated an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma among rs1800629(A;A) genotypes, at an odds ratio of 3.63, p=0.028. ** A study of 441 incident non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases indicated that, compared with the wild-type rs1800629(G;G), the (A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk (odds ratio 2.14, CI: 0.94-4.85), whereas the (A;G) genotype was not. This association was similar for follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. ** A US study  of 1,172 lymphoma patients and 982 controls looked at 57 SNPs in 36 immune function genes. Five SNPs in two cytokine genes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha, were associated with a 1.31x increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63; P = 0.01) and with a 1.64x increase in the subtype known as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23-2.19; P = 0.0007).

The rs1800629 SNP has not been found significant. * Multiple sclerosis (MS)** A study of 300 Croatian and Slovenian patients indicated that rs1800629(A) carriers might be at lower risk for multiple sclerosis. * Nasal polyps** The rs1800629(A;G) genotype was associated with increased risk for nasal polyps in a study of 82 Turkish patients.  ** Another study found a nearly doubled risk for rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio, 1.86; confidence interval, 1.4-3.09). * Psoriasis** A study of 160 Polish patients indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele frequency was significantly decreased among patients with early-onset psoriasis (7.5% vs. 15.4%, p=0.022). ** In contrast, 147 Irish patients with psoriasis were studied and the results indicated that the rs1800629(A;A) genotype was associated with increased risk as well as earlier onset of psoriasis. * Rheumatoid arthritis - response to TNF-alpha inhibitors** 2009 meta-analysis of 9 studies concludes rs1800629(A) allele carriers respond less well to TNF-alpha inhibitors when being treated for rheumatoid arthritis. * Sarcoidosis** In a pooled analysis of seven case-control studies, the odds ratio for sarcoidosis for carriers of the rs1800629(A) allele was either 1.47 (CI 1.03-2.08 under a dominant model) or 1.39 (CI: 0.67-2.90; under a recessive model). * Susceptibility to sepsis** A study of 159 patients with severe trauma indicated that the rs1800629(A) allele was associated with higher risk of developing sepsis and of dying (odds ratio 7.65, two-sided p = 1.9 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). The authors of this research suggest that preemptive anti-inflammatory interventions should be developed for use in carriers of this SNP should they suffer severe injuries. ** A meta-analysis of 25 studies concluded that while rs1800629 status is significantly associated with risk for sepsis, especially among Asians, it was not associated with mortality from sepsis. However, there may be an increased risk for fatal outcomes among Asians (odds ratio 10.75, CI: 3-39, p < 0.01).* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)** A study of 120 Columbian patients with SLE found an increased risk for rs1800629(A) carriers (odds ratio 3.9, CI: 1.65-5.80, p= 0.0004). ** A meta-analysis of 21 studies indicated that in European populations, the rs1800629(A) allele is associated with increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In Europeans, the oodds ratio for the (A;A) genotype was 4.0, CI: 2.5-6.4, p<0.001. No association was detected in Asian-derived populations. The overall odds ratio for rs1800629(A) carriers was 2.0 (CI: 1.3-3.1, p<0.001).  rs1800630 is a SNP upstream of the tumor necrosis alpha (TNF) gene; this SNP is also typically called the -863 variant.In a study of 154 Thai patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rs1800630(A) allele frequency was significantly increased, with an odds ratio of 1.85 (CI: 1.21-2.83, p(corr) = 0.009). This allele was also found to be significantly increased in the SLE group with Raynaud's phenomenon compared to SLE without Raynaud's phenomenon ( odds ratio of 2.23, CI: 1.21-4.10, p(corr) = 0.048).Separately, a meta-analysis of 10 case-control studies, including over 2,200 Graves' disease cases, concluded that rs1800630(A) carriers were associated with the disease. rs1800750, a SNP located at position -376 of the TNF gene, has been linked to increased risk for recurrent acute otitis in a study of 348 children. The (adjusted) odds ratio is 3.06 for (G;G) genotypes (p=0.07).   The TNFalpha gene relates to clinical phenotype in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.

In contrast to most BRCA mutations, which are considered tumor suppressors and functionally recessive, this ATM mutation is considered a dominant negative, since loss of the wild-type allele in tumors with the ATM mutation is not consistently observed.Note that the confidence intervals are quite large, so although the relative risk is calculated as increasing eight-fold, the authors cited indicate that they can only state with 95% confidence that the ""true"" increase in relative risk lies somewhere between 2.8 and 22.5.Somewhat similarly, a 2016 publication study involving 42,000 breast cancer cases concluded that rs28904921(G) carriers had an odds ratio of 11 (CI:1.4-85; p=0.0012) and a 52% (CI: 28-80%) chance of developing the disease by age 70.

hsa,TREM2,"aka c.97C>T (p.Gln33Ter or Q33X)In 2003, researchers concluded that inheriting two copies of rs104894002(T) led to polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy-2 (PLOSL2), also known as Nasu-Hakola disease.More recently (in 2019), a publication concluded that inheriting one copy of the rs104894002(T) allele gives rise to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with this variant appearing to be a fully penetrant mutation among persons surviving to late age (although the authors admit that this is speculative, given the low number of patients known to date).  rs143332484 (p.Arg62His) is a risk variant for Alzheimer's disease found in the TREM2 gene (P = 1.55 × 10-14, OR = 1.67). This gene is highly expressed in microglia which are known to interact with the immune system in AD.         rs75932628(T), a SNP in the TREM2 gene on chromosome 6 resulting in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significantly higher risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease based on two articles published together in 2013 in the New Engl. J. of Med.In one study, the odds ratio for rs75932628(T) was 2.9 (CI: 2.09 to 4.09, P=3.42&#215;10&#8722;10). The mutation had a frequency of 0.46% in controls 85 years of age or older. The authors also observed the association in additional sample sets (odds ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 2.16 to 3.91; P=2.1&#215;10&#8722;12 in combined discovery and replication samples), and found that carriers of rs75932628-T between the ages of 80 and 100 years without Alzheimer's disease had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers (P=0.003).In the other study, analysis of the rs75932628(T) in a series that included 1887 patients with Alzheimer's disease showed a strong, highly significant association (odds ratio, 5.05, CI: 2.77 to 9.16; P=9.0&#215;10&#8722;9). Four other TREM2 gene variants (D87N, T66M, Y38C, and Q33X) were also associated with higher risk for a frontotemporal dementia&#8211;like syndrome when homozygous.Notably, a 2018 study has raised the possibility that in TREM2 R47H mutation carriers, an APOE4 allele may be required for Alzheimer's to develop.Other studies confirming (or in some cases, refuting) an association between R47H and Alzheimer's include: Data shows that rs75932628 is highly significantly associated with the risk of AD across 24,086 AD cases and 148,993 controls of European descent (OR 2.71, p = 4.67 × 10e-25). Based on a study of ~1,000 Alzheimer patients, the R47H mutation does appear to be a risk factor for AD (OR = 2.19, CI:1.04-4.51, p = .03). Individuals with p.R47H associated AD (n = 12) had significantly earlier symptom onset than individuals with no TREM2 variants (n = 551) (55.2 years vs. 61.7 years (p = .02). Based on a Caucasian population comprising ~1,600 late-onset Alzheimer cases, carriers of the R47H variant are at increased risk (OR 7.40, p = 3.66e-06). A study of 474 AD patients from the northwest region of the UK showed a significant association of the R47H mutation with AD (OR 11.08, CI: 2.55-48.09, and Yates' corrected p value = 0.000146). Meta-analysis of 2 family-based and 5 case-control cohorts yielded an overall summary estimate (using case-control data only) for an odds ratio of 1.67 (CI: 0.95-2.92) for the association between the TREM2 R47H and increased AD risk; so while this study replicates the association, it finds a weaker effect than have other studies. A study of ~3,000 AD patients from Spain did see the R47H association with AD (OR 4.12, CI: 1.21-14.00, p = 0.014). A meta-analysis comprising 32,598 subjects from 4 previous studies demonstrated the large effect of the p.R47H variant in AD risk (OR 4.11, CI: 2.99-5.68, p = 5.27×10e-18).

ADH single nucleotide polymorphism associations with alcohol metabolism in vivo. rs283413, also known as c.232G>T, p.Gly78Ter, G78stop and Gly78X, encodes a rare variant of the ADH1C gene that leads to a truncated alcohol dehydrogenase protein. These types of proteins are involved in detoxification and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The rs283413(G) allele is the more common, encoding the amino acid glycine (Gly); the quite rare rs283413(T) allele encodes the variant stop codon (X). Originally identified in three Swedish patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), a study of ~1000 PD patients vs. ~1000 controls indicated an odds ratio for the risk allele of 3.25 (CI:1.31-8.05). This risk is effectively for heterozygotes, since the risk allele is so rare that no homozygotes for it were observed. In a study of 40 index cases, 10% were found to harbor the rs283413(T) risk allele. On its own, this SNP is also said to explain 9.0% of the variability in the rate at which alcohol is metabolized, based on a study of 250 Spaniards. More significantly (in a statistical sense), this study concluded that combinations of this SNP and others were shown to affect alcohol metabolism; most of these combinations are represented by the gs211 genoset.

The study suggest the effect is likely entirely due to rs608995, whose minor allele was almost always seen with PROGINS allele. For rs1042838, the risk allele in orientation to the corresponding dbSNP entry is (T). Subsequent studies have not replicated this high odds ratio, nor the apparent recessive model in this study. The small number of homozygous carriers in the study probably explains this outlier. A 2010 study  of 2888 cases and 4483 controls could not reproduce the association of this SNP with ovarian cancer, even adjusting for ethnicity and BMI. The study concludes their sample size had >90% power to detect OR 1.3 for this SNP, so if an effect exists it must be quite small. A pooled analysis of 4788 ovarian cancer cases and 7614 controls in 2008 suggested that PROGINS risk is limited to invasive endometrioid subtype , to that effect a 2010 study found association with endometrial cancer  with same risk haplotypes as the earlier haplotype study on ovarian cancer. A 2014 metastudy  however did find association between PROGINS and ovarian cancer, but statistically significant only for Caucasians, those having never used oral contraceptives, and serous (endometrial) cancers, while another meta-study  looking at endometrial cancer specifically found association (OR 1.52-2.72, p = 0.0008-0.03) among European women in particular.This SNP has also been reported to be associated with migraine-associated vertigo (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0007). SNPs in genes involved in female hormonal pathways have been a subject of particular interest in the study of migraines because females appear to be more prone to migraines than males. Previous studies had suggested that the minor allele of this SNP might also influence breast cancer. However, a 2009 European study of 30,000 breast cancer cases, compared to 30,000 controls, found no association, or as they put it, ""persuasive evidence against an overall association between invasive breast cancer risk and (this SNP)"".

hsa,UGT1A3,"Clinically relevant UGT1A10 variant.              UGT1A1*28 duplication allele inserts a seventh (TA) pair to six (TA) pairs this reducing the activity to 30% of normal.See the following SNPs, which have been merged to rs3064744 on dbSNP:rs34815109rs35600288  Although the insertion is supposed to be the minor allele, the majority of FTDNA v2 and 23andMe v2 results show II as the result, so use caution when interpreting this result.rs34815109 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers. These risks include:* An increased risk for breast cancer is reported in premenopausal African-American women, based on a study of 200 women. The reported odds ratio was 1.8 (CI: 1.0-3.1, p=0.06) for carriers of one or more UGT1A1*28 alleles.* In colorectal cancer patients being treated with irinotecan, adverse side effects (neutropenia and/or severe diarrhea) are reported to be strongly associated with the number of UGT1A1*28 alleles. Patients homozygous for the *28 allele are 3.5 times more likely to develop severe neutropenia compared with individuals with the wild genotype. The FDA has approved a genetic test for UGT1A1 status to be used to determine dosage when considering irinotecan therapy  FDA press release. However, no prospective study has examined whether a reduced dose of irinotecan results in a reduced rate of adverse drug events.* Hyperbilirubinemia, a potentially toxic increase in bilirubin levels, is possible among rs34815109(TA;TA) individuals treated with the drug tranilast.The three other SNPs that describe the same polymorphism are:* rs34983651* rs35600288* rs5839491  rs34983651 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene; the primary entry in SNPedia for this set of SNPs is at rs34815109. Futhermore, several of these SNPs now have been merged by dbSNP to rs3064744.The other two SNPs (besides rs34815109) that also describe the same polymorphism are:* rs35600288* rs5839491Note: DNA testing companies reporting genotypes as ""II"", ""DI"" or ""DD"" for this SNP may vary in how they define those terms for this SNP. In general, based on Promethease user data, it appears as if Ancestry's v2c and v2d chips interpret the normal allele as ""D"", whereas 23andMe v2-v4 chips interpret it as ""I"". These chips (v2-v4) appear to have false negatives for this SNP, and this SNP is not reported on the v5 chip.    rs35600288 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene; the primary entry in SNPedia for this set of SNPs is at rs34815109.The other two SNPs (besides rs34815109) that also describe the same polymorphism are:* rs34983651* rs5839491 aka c.-1352A= (and probably also c.-1353A=)The ""A"" variant (T in dbSNP orientation) has been observed in a few Japanese newborns with hyperbilirubinemia, but the association is hardly causative, and even the authors conclude the pathogenicity is ""uncertain"".  The (C;C) genotype is linked to reduced UGT1A1 activity, and increased Bilirubin, except in people of African origin for whom the T allele is a risk factor for breast cancer.

hsa,ABCB1,"rs10248420 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is unconfirmed. In clinic, even the lower concentrations of drugs may achieve sufficient antidepressant effect, and the dose of the drug can be adjusted upwards until the patient responds. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect in depression and eight that they do not. rs10248420 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele. The list of the 9 SNPs is shown below.When treated for depression with citalopram, paroxetine, amitriptyline, or venlafaxine (substrates of the protein encoded by ABCB1), a highly statistically significant association between the overall genetic variability of these SNPs and remission was reported by Uhr et al in a study of ~400 German inpatients.. However, this result has to be treated with caution. A well-run, double-blind study of ABCB1 substrate citalopram in depression (STAR-D study) and a following meta-analysis  failed to replicate several Uhr et al. results for other ABCB1 SNPs.The 9 SNPs in the linkage block identified are :* rs2235067* rs4148740* rs2032583* rs4148739* rs11983225* rs2235040* rs12720067* rs7787082* rs10248420 rs10248420 and rs2032583 associated with colonic disease Identifying candidate causal variants responsible for altered activity of the ABCB1 multidrug resistance gene.   rs1045642, also known as C3435T, is a SNP located in the ABCB1 gene. It is often studied in conjunction with rs2032582. C3435T has been mentioned by:*  A ""Silent"" Polymorphism in the MDR1 Gene Changes Substrate Specificity (for example, to verapamil)*  (R)-lansoprazole (Prevacid) concentrations are significantly increased in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers with ABCB1 C3435T C allele.*  In a Korean population, plasma concentrations of fexofenadine (Allegra) were 17% lower in 2677AA/3435CC subjects and 47% higher in the 2677TT/3435TT subjects compared to 2677GG/3435CC subjects.*  In contrast, in this study no association was observed between the C3435T polymorphism and fexofenadine plasma or urine concentrations in a German Caucasian population.*  A meta-analysis including 9 case-control studies (totaling ~2,500 patients) found no association between rs1045642 and epilepsy riskA study of 98 methadone-maintaining patients concluded that the higher (>150 mg/day) and lower (< or =150 mg/day) methadone dose groups differed significantly in their rs1128503 status (experiment-wise p = 0.0325). Furthermore, individuals with the 3-locus genotype pattern (T;T)-(T;T)-(T;T) for SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503, respectively, had an approximately 5-fold chance of requiring the 'higher' methadone dose, while individuals heterozygous for these three SNPs have an approximately 3-fold chance of stabilizing at the 'lower' methadone dose (point-wise p-value = 0.026).

A large (900 subjects) well-run, double-blind study of ABCB1 substrate citalopram in depression (STAR-D study) and a following meta-analysis  failed to replicate several Uhr et al. results for other ABCB1 SNPs in this block.The 9 SNPs in the linkage block identified are :* rs2235067* rs4148740* rs2032583* rs4148739* rs11983225* rs2235040* rs12720067* rs7787082* rs10248420  rs2032582, also known as G2677T, is a nonsynonymous SNP located in exon 21 of the ABCB1 gene. G2677 is also known as Ala893Thr. It is often studied in conjunction with rs1045642.The rs2032582(T) variant allele yields a 2.6 fold higher risk of developing lung cancer, and in particular, the type of lung cancer called squamous cell carcinoma (CI 1.7-4.0, P < .001) in white Spanish smokers. There appears to be little gene dosage effect, since homozygous rs2032582(T;T) carriers shoulder almost all the risk (odds ratio 6.75 compared to (A;A) homozygotes, CI 3.0-15.2). This risk is also the same in light or heavy smokers.  A study of 98 methadone-maintaining patients concluded that the higher (>150 mg/day) and lower (< or =150 mg/day) methadone dose groups differed significantly in their rs1128503 status (experiment-wise p = 0.0325). Furthermore, individuals with the 3-locus genotype pattern (T;T)-(T;T)-(T;T) for SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503, respectively, had an approximately 5-fold chance of requiring the 'higher' methadone dose, while individuals heterozygous for these three SNPs have an approximately 3-fold chance of stabilizing at the 'lower' methadone dose (point-wise p-value = 0.026).OMIM also reports an association with Crohn's disease. rs2032583 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and newer antidepressant drugs ,. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is to be confirmed. A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2032583(C) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates had better chances on remission. However,could not be reproduced in a large (~900) -trial with outpatient with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , the significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome among all studies with this SNP becomes insignificant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. However, the association remained significant after Bonferroni-correction in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients.rs2032583 is one of 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele. The 9 SNPs in the linkage block identified are :* rs2235067* rs4148740* rs2032583* rs4148739* rs11983225* rs2235040* rs12720067* rs7787082* rs10248420In contrast,  reported on two SNPs from the block, rs2032583 and rs2235040, that these SNPs are close to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (not inherited together) in their 81% white population. Other results from  are unreliable because they picked an antidepressant sertraline, which is, likely, not an ABCB1 substrate , as an example of an ABCB1 substrate and treated a majority of patients in the study with it.  rs10248420 and rs2032583 associated with colonic disease       rs2235015 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein (P-glycoprotein - Pgp) that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier. SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. Clinical studies on antidepressant drug dosage, plasma medication levels and treatment outcome suggest monotonic associations for tricyclic antidepressant drugs  and threshold models or higher order relationships for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors PMID 28648553 and newer antidepressant drugs ,.  However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is still to be confirmed. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect on depression outcome and eight - that they do not. However those 18 studies are difficult to compare because they vary within their study design concerning following factors: population (ethnicity, psychiatric condition), tested SNPs, tested antidepressants (Pgp substrates and Pgp non-substrates) and doses, inclusion of drug metabolism monitoring and statistical correction for multiple testing.A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al  found that rs2235015(T) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates were more likely to remit. However, this result could not be reproduced in a large (N~900) trial with outpatients with major depression treated with the ABCB1 substrate citalopram (STAR-D study, level 1). According to a recent meta analysis , no significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome with this SNP among all studies, but the association remained significant in a subgroup-analysis of all inpatients. rs2235015 is near the 9 SNPs found within a tight linkage block (r<sup>2</sup> >= 0.8 ) such that the minor allele at any one of them predicts (with ~80%+ accuracy) that the other SNPs will also be the minor allele.

SNPs in ABCB1 may thus influence the intracerebral concentrations of certain drugs and their efficacy or potential for adverse side effects. However, the link between the increased brain concentrations of antidepressants and a clinically significant response is unconfirmed. In clinic, even the lower concentrations of drugs may achieve sufficient antidepressant effect, and the dose of the drug can be adjusted upwards until the patient responds. According to a recent review , ten studies reported that ABCB1 SNPs have clinical effect in depression and eight - that they do not.A study of ~400 of German psychiatric inpatients with depression conducted in 2007 by Uhr et al.  found that rs2235040(A) carriers treated with ABCB1 substrates were more likely to remit. However, this result failed to reproduce in a large (900 outpatient subjects) and better designed double-blind study of a well-researched ABCB1 substrate citalopram in depression (STAR-D study). According to a recent meta analysis , no significant association of antidepressant treatment outcome with this SNP. There was a significant association with treatment outcome in the inpatients subsample but data regarding rs2235040 and treatment outcome among inpatients entirely stemmed from the study by Uhr et al.The 9 SNPs in the linkage block identified are :* rs2235067* rs4148740* rs2032583* rs4148739* rs11983225* rs2235040* rs12720067* rs7787082* rs10248420In contrast,  reported on two SNPs from the block, rs2032583 and rs2235040, that these SNPs are in a weak disequilibrium (not always inherited together) in their 81% white population. Other results from  are unreliable because the authors used an antidepressant sertraline, which is, likely, not an ABCB1 substrate , as an example of an ABCB1 substrate and treated most of the patients in the study with sertraline.   rs2235067 is a SNP in the ABCB1 gene (also known as the MDR1 gene), which encodes a protein that transports certain molecules across the blood-brain barrier.

hsa,PEMT,"A study of the PEMT gene in schizophrenia.     rs7946, a SNP in the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase PEMT gene and also known as +5465G-A, leads to a V175M (valine to methionine at amino acid position 175) substitution in the PEMT protein, and is a loss of function mutation. Caucasians with nonalcoholic fatty liver are more likely to carry the rs7946(T), with the effect being most pronounced for rs7946(T;T) genotypes. However, rs7946(T) carriers are in general not more likely to have fatty liver, based on a study of many more patients, including ones of Hispanic and African-American descent. How can this be? One explanation () suggests the following:* Caucasians have a different distribution of this SNP than do Hispanics and African Americans;* Having this SNP may be necessary, but is not sufficient, to cause fatty liver, as many individuals with the SNP have normal liver fat;* Probably this SNP does slow the export of fat from liver, but only rs7946 carrying individuals who also take in too many calories too quickly (i.e. overeat) will wind up with fatty livers.

hsa,MDM4,"Modifying effect of MDM4 variants on risk of HPV16-associated squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx.    Rs4245739 at 1q32 is located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region (UTR) of MDM4, positioned 32 bp downstream from the gene.  The MDM4 oncoprotein negatively regulates the tumor suppressor protein P53, effectively inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell growth.  Amplification of MDM4 is observed in multiple tumor types, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated SNP rs4245739 with several forms of cancer.SNPs that are situated in 3&#8217;-UTRs can potentially affect translation efficiency by altering miRNA-mediated gene regulation.  The '''rs4245739''' A > C polymorphism creates a novel binding site for miR-191 , thereby inhibiting expression of the ''MDM4'' oncogene.  Consequently, the major allele A acts as the risk allele, while the minor allele C is protective.===Prostate Cancer===A GWAS by Eeles et al.  linked rs4245739 to prostate cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related death for men in the developed world &#8211; especially in Europe and the United States.  Eeles et al. used the iCOGS chip to genotype 19,662 prostate cancer cases and 19,715 controls, all of European ancestry.  The results were subsequently pooled with data from a meta-analysis of 4 previous GWAS covering 11,085 cases and 11,463 controls in populations with European ancestry.  The combined results identified 77 loci associated with prostate cancer, which together explain ~30% of the disease&#8217;s familial risk.  One of the new SNPs identified was '''rs4245739''', which presented genome-wide significance (p = 2.1e-11).  The major allele A is the risk allele, with a per-allele odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05 &#8211; 1.14).  '''Rs4245739''' is correlated with rs1380576 (''r''<sup>2</sup> = 0.89), which has been linked to prostate cancer aggressiveness , as well as rs7556371 (''r''<sup>2</sup> = 0.89), which was associated with prostate cancer susceptibility in a candidate gene study .===Breast Cancer===Rs4245739 has also been linked to susceptibility for breast cancer, which ranks as the fifth-most common cause of cancer death worldwide.  In another GWAS utilizing the iCOGS array, Garcia-Glosas et al.  investigated loci associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, which account for ~25% of all breast cancer cases.  They genotyped 6,514 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 41,455 controls of European ancestry, the results of which were combined with a meta-analysis of 3 previous GWAS totaling 4,193 ER-negative cases and 35,194 controls, also of European ancestry.  SNP '''rs4245739''' was identified as one of four loci associated with ER-negative but not ER-positive breast cancer.  Based on the pooled results, the association with ER-negative breast cancer showed genome-wide significance (p = 2.1e-12).  The A risk allele presented an odds ratio of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.10&#8211;1.18).A candidate gene study  genotyped a total of 1,100 breast cancer cases and 1,400 controls from two regions of China.  This work focused specifically on breast cancer in relation to SNP '''rs4245739''' and its potential interplay with the P53 Arg72Pro genetic variant.  When compared to CA and CC, the AA genotype was found to be associated with breast cancer (p =  4.6e-6), with an odds ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.36&#8211;0.61) for the C protective allele.  For individuals with the P53 Arg/Arg genotype, the association was even stronger (p = 5.3e-12) with an odds ratio of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.08&#8211;0.27), suggesting a possible additive effect of ''MDM4'' and ''P53'' on breast cancer susceptibility.Additionally, smaller scale studies have reported association of rs4245739 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  and ovarian cancer severity and progression .",,,SNPedia

hsa,CYP2C19,"rs12248560(T) defines the CYP2C19*17 allele, an ultra fast metabolizer phenotype of the CYP2C19 gene.CYP2C19*17 is likely to lead to less effective drug treatment by, for example, proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole) and antidepressants.On the other hand, cancer patients who are CYP2C19*17 carriers are more likely to benefit from tamoxifen treatment, presumably because they break it down more rapidly into the antiestrogenic metabolites endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. A study of 1,000+ breast cancer patients showed a 0.77x decreased risk of breast cancer for carriers of a CYP2C19*17 allele (CI: 0.65-0.93, p = 0.005). Analysis of a subgroup of such carriers who were using hormone therapy for ten years or longer showed an even stronger effect (odds ratio 0.57, CI: 0.39-0.83, p = 0.003). The theory is that ultra fast metabolism of estrogen leads to lower estrogen levels and lower breast cancer risk.Clopidogrel Efficacy    The rs17878459(C) SNP defines the CYP2C19 allele known as CYP2C19*2B, or as E92D.

The rs17884712(A) allele defines the CYP2C19 variant known as CYP2C19*9, which is associated with a slight decrease in the metabolism of S-mephenytoin (at least in vitro).   rs28399504 is a SNP in the CYP2C19 gene, potentially encoding the CYP2C19*4 variant. This variant has been linked to poor metabolism of compounds like mephenytoin. It is also known as M1V or Met1Val.The risk allele is rs28399504(G).As a nonfunctioning CYP2C19, this variant would be expected to be a poor metabolizer of several commonly prescribed drugs, including anti-ulcer drugs like omeprazole (trade names Losec and Prilosec), esomeprazole (trade name Nexium), and lansoprazole (Prevacid).According to / a 23andMe discussion This is one of the SNPs which were re-analyzed April 2009.

Defines the CYP2C19 variant known as CYP2C19*8.Carriers of the rs41291556(C) allele may have decreased activity and poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype. This variant is associated with a dramatic (approximately 90% and 70%) reduction in the metabolism of S-mephenytoin and tolbutamide in vitro.Clopidogrel Efficacy rs4244285 is a SNP in the CYP2C19 gene, potentially encoding the CYP2C19*2 variant. This variant is the most common reason for poor metabolism of compounds like mephenytoin (an anti-convulsant), some antidepressants, the anti-platelet drug Plavix, and some drugs used for ulcer conditions of various types. The risk allele is rs4244285(A).As a nonfunctioning CYP2C19, this variant would be expected to be a poor metabolizer of several commonly prescribed drugs, including anti-ulcer drugs like omeprazole (trade names Losec and Prilosec), esomeprazole (trade name Nexium), and lansoprazole (trade name Prevacid).In Caucasians, SNPs in CYP2C19 are relatively rare (in contrast to SNPs in CYP2D6), but SNPs in this gene are common in Asians. Ulcer treatment with omeprazole to reduce Helicobacter pylori has been shown to vary depending on a patient's CYP2C19 genotype, varying from 28% in patients homozygous for CYP2C19 alleles encoding fully functional proteins to 100% in patients with variations leading to poor metabolism. The fact that poor metabolizers for many cytochrome p450s achieve higher therapeutic success for some drugs is speculated to be because for some of the drug being broken down (ie metabolized) slower, the effective concentrations are both higher and longer lasting. However, other drugs clearly work less well in carriers of reduced function CYP2C19 alleles. An example of such a drug is clopidogrel, sold under the brand name Plavix. This has now (2010) been acknowledged by the FDA, who have added a boxed warning to Plavix, alerting patients and health care professionals that the drug can be less effective in people who have CYP2C19 variants and cannot convert the drug as effectively to its active form. recent (December 2008) studies reach similar (though not identical) conclusions about the consequences of CYP2C19*2 allele carriers prescribed clopidogrel to reduce their cardiovascular risk:* A study of 245 French patients under 45 years of age prescribed clopidogrel after surviving a first heart attack concluded that rs4244285(A) allele carriers were at 4x higher risk (CI: 1&#183;81&#8212;9&#183;02, p=0&#183;0006) for subsequent adverse cardiovascular events compared to noncarriers.* A study of 2,208 French patients prescribed clopidogrel, of which 225 subsequently died and 94 had a nonfatal heart attack or stroke, came to two conclusions :** Patients carrying any two CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles (*2, *3, *4, or *5), had about a 2x increased risk (21.5% vs. 13.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.98; CI: 1.10-3.58) for adverse cardiovascular events than CYP2C19*1 homozygotes.** Among the 1,535 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty) during hospitalization, patients with two CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles were at even higher risk for adverse events: 3.58x (CI: 1.71-7.51) compared to CYP2C19*1 homozygotes.* A study of 1,477 subjects with acute coronary syndromes who were treated with clopidogrel as part of the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TRITON-TIMI) 38 study concluded that rs4244285(A) allele carriers had a 1.53x increased risk for death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke, as compared with noncarriers (12.1% vs. 8.0%; CI: 1.07-2.19, p=0.01) and were at 3x higher risk of stent thrombosis (2.6% vs. 0.8%; CI: 1.19-8.00, p=0.02). * CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function genotypes were associated with diminished platelet response to clopidogrel treatment and poorer cardiovascular outcomes in a study of 429 healthy Amish individuals treated for 7 days (in the first study) and 227 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty) (in the second study).

Personality disorder patients carrying the DBH TT genotype exhibited higher neuroticism and novelty seeking scores as compared to individuals with the (C;C) or (C;T) genotype. Analyses on the level of the neuroticism and novelty seeking subscales revealed that the DBH (T;T) genotype was primarily associated with personality features related to impulsiveness and aggressive hostility. Also adult ADHD patients carrying the homozygous (T;T) genotypes displayed by significantly increased neuroticism scores; when both personality disorder and adult ADHD patient were analyzed together, (T;T) carriers also displayed by significantly lower conscientiousness levels. This study concludes that rs1611115(T;T) homozygotes appear to be at increased risk for personality traits related to impulsiveness, aggression, and adult ADHD.

hsa,AMPD1,"This position is odd. Under the older reference genome build36, it was on the plus strand; in build37 it is on the minus strand. This makes it very prone to some ambiguous flip confusion in the literature, plus, 23andMe users have self-reported the flipped form. IN addition, instead of the usual SNP listed as having 2 alleles, all 4 alleles are reported in dbSNP, even if this is probably due to the strand changes. dbSNP currently says the normal allele is C, and T is the rare geno which causes a premature stop, early in the gene. We at SNPedia suspect that the A & G alleles are not common enough to have ever been genuinely reported, but for de-novo mutations each allele would be non-synonymous and result in a different amino acid. , a SNP located in the AMPD1 gene and also known as 'C34T', has at times been called the ""most prevalent genetic disease mutation"", at least in Caucasians.  Perhaps up to 10% of Caucasians and African-American carry one C34T allele (i.e. carry one rs17602729(A) allele) - and actually, most of them are unaware of any medically related issues since they don't typically have any particular symptoms that would warrant a trip to the doctor.So what's the issue? The AMPD1 gene encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase, which is one of the key enzymes used to process the energy source ATP. The C34T variation causes a premature stop in the protein, leading to a nonfunctional AMPD1 enzyme. Some individuals - but by no means all or even a majority apparently - who are AMPD1 deficient get muscle cramps and pains when they exert themselves. The most common genotype bringing this about is rs17602729(A;A), i.e. the individuals who carry two copies of the C34T allele and therefore have no functioning AMPD1 allele. It is not known why only some of C34T homozygotes experience muscle myalgia.Heterozygotes, i.e. rs17602729(A;G) individuals, do not seem to suffer any exercise or fitness related deficit. In fact, one of the best elite Caucasian distance runners is known to be a C34T heterozygote. In fact, heterozygotes for rs17602729 may even have advantages over those lacking a C34T allele. The most striking study reported that C34T heterozygotes are 8.6 fold (CI: 3.05 - 23.87) more likely to survive for more than 5 years without needing a heart transplant after a congestive heart failure related hospitalization than the wild-type homozygotes (i.e. rs17602729(G;G) homozygotes).  Similarly, C34T heterozygotes with coronary artery disease seem to fare better than wild-type homozygotes. This is one of the SNPs reported by NutraHacker SNPs|NutraHacker.

hsa,JAK1,"rs11208534 is a polymorphism within intron 3 of the Janus-activated kinase (JAK1) gene on human chromosome 1.  This SNP is reported by dbSNP as having A (ancestral) and G alleles, with a minor allele frequency of 19.2% (dbSNP). JAK1 is a membrane-associated protein-tyrosine kinase involved in the interferon-alpha/beta and &#8211;gamma pathways, which are important for immune responses to pathogens. Activation of JAK-family proteins occurs after binding of interferons to cell-surface receptors, and results in tyrosine phosphorylation of members of the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) protein family, inducing the expression of many other genes involved in diverse biological processes including various antiviral responses .This SNP has been associated with increased risk of developing severe symptoms upon infection with dengue virus. Symptoms of dengue infection vary widely in severity, and are classified by the WHO (listed in order of increasing severity) as undifferentiated fever, dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and severe hypovolemic shock, or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DF commonly includes high fever, general flu-like symptoms, and sometimes severe bleeding. DHF is characterized by high fever, major hemorrhaging, circulatory failure, and extremely low blood platelet counts and if untreated can progress to DSS ( correlation was found between rs11208534 and the development of symptoms consistent with DHF in a 2010 study in Brazil of individuals seropositive for dengue virus . The top hit out of 728 SNPs in 56 genes predicted to be involved in a cellular response to viral infection was rs11208534, for which the authors report T (major) and C (minor) alleles of rs11208534, not A and G as on dbSNP. Cases (n = 50) were recruited from patients with DHF-like symptoms by active hospital surveillance in the city of Salvador, Brazil. Controls (n = 236) who had experienced symptoms of DF, but not DHF, were recruited from families living within 1 kilometer of index cases, and were matched in age categories under and over 15 years. The association between rs11208534 and DHF (P-value 2.9x10-4; OR 5.2 (95% CI 2.1-12.7) just failed to reach the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 2.6x10-4 by itself, but when combined with two other highly linked SNPs in the JAK1 gene region, rs310196 and rs2780831 (D&#8217; 0.856 and 1.0 to rs11208534 respectively), the association reached significance with a P-value of 2.1x10-4. This study provides evidence that polymorphisms in the JAK1 gene, including this one, may provide differential susceptibility to dengue virus infection, and likely other viruses as well.

Heterozygotes may be at slightly higher risk.    rs2074190(G;G) and rs2074190(A;G) genotypes for the TBX21 gene are calculated to be at 2.19 fold higher risk (CI: 1.27-3.77) for aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) compared to rs2074190(A;A) homozygotes, based on a study of 72 patients vs 640 controls in a study of a Japanese population. Note that in this population, but perhaps not others, linkage disequilibrium exists between this SNP located in the first exon, rs2074190, and a SNP located upstream of the gene, rs4794067, with a predictive accuracy of 92%. This SNP encodes a variation in the 33rd amino acid of the protein encoded by the TBX21 gene. Although 95% or so of all Caucasians carry two copies of the rs2240017(G) allele, as oriented in dbSNP orientation, and are thus rs2240017(G;G) homozygotes, a few individuals are rs2240017(C;G) heterozygotes. These heterozgotes are reported to improve better over time in response to corticosteroid treatment for asthma than the rs2240017(G;G) homozygotes. So far, studies have not linked, however, this SNP to any change in the overall risk of asthma itself. Although the effect observed was strong, in that treating rs2240017(C;G) heterozygotes ultimately (over 4 years) yields average airway responsiveness in the normal range (i.e. in the same range as for nonasthmatics), the authors point out that the relatively small number of heterozygous children studied indicates that a larger study is warranted to ensure reproducibility. It is also unknown whether the effect is limited to the particular corticosteroid used (budesonide, aka Rhinocort) in this study. This is thought to be unlikely, though, given the general nature of the drug. rs4794067(C;C) and rs4794067(C;T) genotypes for the TBX21 gene are calculated to be at 2.15 fold higher risk (CI: 1.26-3.64) for aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) compared to rs4794067(T;T) homozygotes, based on a study of 72 patients vs 640 controls in a study of a Japanese population. Note that in this population, but perhaps not others, linkage disequilibrium exists between this SNP located upstream of the gene, rs4794067, and a common synonymous SNP located in the first exon, rs2074190, with a predictive accuracy of 92%.On the other hand, rs4794067(C;C) may greatly decrease the risk of lupus if rs17250932(C;C) is also present (at least in Chinese people).

It has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and lupus nephritis in SLE patients.In connection with Alzheimer's disease (AD):* A study of 127 Finnish patients concluded that the rs2333227(T) allele increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease by 3.8 fold. This was derived by noting that a man with an ApoE allele has an AD odds ratio of 3.0 if they don't also have an rs2333227(T) allele, and an odds ratio of 11.4 if they do.* A study of 148 Italian sporadic AD patients yielded an odds ratio for the rs2333227(C;C) genotype (as oriented in dbSNP orientation) of 1.78 (CI: 1.13-2.80). The presence of rs669(G;G), in addition to rs2333227(C;C), appears to  synergistically increase the risk of AD to an odds ratio of 25.5 (CI: 4.65-139.75), regardless of ApoE status.In connection with lung cancer:* A pooled analysis of data from 10 studies (3688 cases) found an odds ratio for lung cancer of 0.88 (CI: 0.80-0.97) for rs2333227(C;T) heterozygotes, and 0.71 (CI: 0.57-0.88) for (T;T) homozygotes. This protective effect applied to both men and women, and appeared to apply to ""ever"" smokers but not ""never"" smokers.In connection with lupus nephritis:* While there was no association with lupus (SLE) per se in this study of 200+ African-American patients, the risk of developing lupus nephritis among SLE patients was significantly higher among rs2333227(C;T) heterozygotes compared with (C;C) homozygotes (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.12-3.97), and it was even higher for (T;T) homozygotes versus (C;C) (odds ratio 3.52, CI: 1.41-8.77).In connection with gastric cancer:* rs2333227(T) carriers are at increased risk for gastric cancer, based on a study of 157 Taiwanese patients.

The G allele appears to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.  rs2758346 rs4880 and rs2855116 association with Alzheimer's disease    The rs4880(T) allele, part of the codon for amino acid valine at codon 16 of the antioxidant protein from the mitochrondrial superoxide dismutase 2 SOD2 gene, is the most common in most populations studied. The rs4880(C) allele gives rise to an alanine at this position is it also known as Val16Ala manganese superoxide dismutase, or A16V. There appears to be some conflict in the literature over the effect of this SNP. Having a valine at codon 16 is said to reduce enzyme activity , and thus lead to increased oxidative stress, yet in at least one study of the actual enzyme levels measured in people, SOD2 activity was 33% higher in (C;T) or (T;T) individuals compared to (C;C) individuals . Regardless of how this resolves, several phenotypic associations have been reported for this SNP, including:* A 10 fold higher risk for heart disease in hereditary hemochromatosis patients with rs4880(T;T) genotypes compared to similar patients with rs4880(C;T) or rs4880(C;C) genotypes. * An increased risk of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) was found in individuals with rs4880(C;C) (OR = 3.07, CI: 1.55-6.05) genotypes. Odds ratios for developing mesothelioma were even higher for patients lacking obvious exposure to asbestos fibers. * Among prostate cancer patients with a rs4880(T;T) genotype, but not the (C;C) genotype, higher iron intake level was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in risk for aggressive forms of the cancer (OR=2.3, CI: 1.0-4.9).* rs4880(C;T) prostate cancer patients being treated by radiation therapy are more likely (8% compared to 0%, p=0.02) to exhibit a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding after irradiation than (C;C) or (T;T) patients, based on a study of 135 patients.

The COMT gene codes for the COMT enzyme, which breaks down dopamine in the brain's prefrontal cortex.  The wild-type allele is a (G), coding for a valine amino acid; the (A) substitution polymorphism changes the amino acid to a methionine.  This alters the structure of the resultant enzyme such that its activity is only 25% of the wild type.  As a result, A allele carriers have more dopamine in their prefrontal cortex, which may be responsible for many of the neuropsychological associations listed below./ 23andMe blog summarizes the alleles at this SNP as*rs4680(A) = Worrier. Met, more exploratory, lower COMT enzymatic activity, therefore higher dopamine levels; lower pain threshold, enhanced vulnerability to stress, yet also more efficient at processing information under most conditions*rs4680(G) = Warrior. Val, less exploratory, higher COMT enzymatic activity, therefore lower dopamine levels; higher pain threshold, better stress resiliency, albeit with a modest reduction in executive cognition performance under most conditionsRoughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at ) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.Specific studies include:rs4680, a functional Val/Met polymorphism, showed modest association with Irish familial schizophrenia.

Lipoprotein(a) genetic variants associated with coronary and peripheral vascular disease but not with stroke risk in the Heart Protection Study.

Cost-effectiveness model of use of genetic testing as an aid in assessing the likely benefit of aspirin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.    rs3798220, also known as I4399M or Ile4399Met, is a SNP in the apolipoprotein(A) LPA gene that has been reported to be associated with elevated plasma lipoprotein(a) Lp(a) and increased cardiovascular risk, and in particular, coronary artery disease.In one study, 25,131 initially healthy Caucasian participants in the Women's Health Study were followed for ~10 years. rs3798220(C) allele carriers (3.7%) in the placebo (i.e. not receiving aspirin) group had a 2x higher risk of major cardiovascular events than non-carriers (age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.21, CI: 1.39-3.52). Among rs3798220(C) carriers, the risk was reduced more than twofold by aspirin: for aspirin compared with placebo the age-adjusted HR was 0.44 (CI: 0.20-0.94). The risk was not significantly reduced among non-carriers (age-adjusted HR=0.91, CI: 0.77-1.08). This interaction between carrier status and aspirin allocation was significant (P=0.048). In summary, rs3798220(C) carriers had higher plasma lipoprotein(a) and had double the risk of cardiovascular events, but also benefited more from taking aspirin. In another study, compared with noncarriers, carriers of the 4399M risk allele (2.7% of controls) had an adjusted odds ratio for severe CAD of 3.14 (CI: 1.51 to 6.56), and had 5-fold higher median plasma lipoprotein(a) levels (P=0.003), leading to the conclusion that the LPA I4399M SNP is associated with severe CAD and plasma lipoprotein(a) levels. celera says rs3798220 is an independent predictor of risk for *Coronary Heart Disease in men and women*event reduction from low dose aspirin therapy in womenCarriers of the rs3798220(C) have higher levels of plasma Lp(a).

Association was strongest with the ICD-10 definitions of alcoholism, with P=0.046 for PDTsum and 0.029 for PDTaverage; it was also significant for DSM-IV for PDTaverage (P=0.039). The high-risk allele was the C that encodes ADH1B*1, and the low-risk allele encodes ADH1B*3.A review of the (at times conflicting) findings regarding ADH1B genotypes and maternal and fetal alcohol syndromes is available. some African American and Native American populations, the ADH1B*3 allele (Arg369Cys in exon 9) is correlated with protection against alcoholism.    rs6413413, also known as Thr60Ser, is a SNP in the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B ADH1B gene. The rs6413413(A) allele is the more common, encoding the amino acid threonine (Thr); the quite rare rs6413413(T) allele encodes the variant serine (Ser). On it's own, this SNP is said to explain 2.5% of the variability in the rate at which alcohol is metabolized, based on a study of 250 Spaniards.More significantly (in a statistical sense), this study concluded that combinations of this SNP and others were shown to affect alcohol metabolism; most of these combinations are represented by the gs211genoset.Note that the effects of alcohol are higher in individuals who break down (basically, detoxify) ethanol more slowly.",,,SNPedia

This is classified as a sleep disorder, although it does not appear to have any known negative medical consequence.The correlation between P384R and FNSS was first reported in 2009. In 2014, an independent group studying a (relatively small) group of people also saw the correlation between P384 and FNSS, while also finding another similiar variant in the BHLHE41 gene, Y362H (c.1084C>T; also known as Tyr362His). The Y362H variant does not have a dbSNP SNP designation at this time.

hsa,DSP,"aka c.4180C>T (p.Gln1394Ter)Reported in ClinVar as pathogenic for dilated cardiomyopathy and likely pathogenic for arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia; also reported in a sudden cardiac death patient           The SNP '''rs2076295''' on chromosome 6p24 is located within the intronic region of the DSP gene, which encodes the protein desmoplakin. Desmoplakin is a component of the desmosome, and is an adhesive intercellular molecule that tightly links adjacent cells for cell-cell adhesion. It is part of a dynamic structure that involves other proteins, such as plakoglobin and plakophilins, which tether the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane . The minor allele rs2076295(G) is reported by dbSNP to have an allele frequency (MAF) of 0.454.A recent case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 1,616 cases and 4,683 controls (and a replication study with 876 cases and 1,890 controls) was performed on non- Hispanic white individuals with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) ; note the correction posted online 1 Oct 2013. The most common and severe form of IIP is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IFP), and all forms of IIP (including IFP) were included in this study, in which a total of 439,828 SNPs were studied. Using an additive model for the minor allele at each SNP, a total of 19 SNPs, representing 7 chromosome locations, with genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) were identified in the GWAS discovery process.Apart from SNPs that have been previously associated with IIP in the MUC5B, TERT, and TERC genes , many of the other genome-wide significant SNPs reported in this study were newly discovered risk loci for IIP. Among them is '''rs2076295''' (minor allele = G; P<sub>meta</sub> = 1.1 x 10<sup>-19</sup>), which is in the intronic region of the DSP gene, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.43 for IIP (discovery GWAS). A related lung tissue gene expression study (100 IPF cases, 94 controls) showed that DSP expression was down-regulated in cases when compared to controls (P = 0.0002), and the expression level was genotype-dependent on the SNP (P = 0.002) &#8211; relative expression of DSP decreased with the number of copies of the putative risk allele, with GG alleles having the lowest level of expression, and TT the highest. This is consistent with the additive model used in the discovery GWAS.IIP represents a group of lung diseases that are often characterized by pulmonary fibrosis or progressive scarring of the alveolar interstitium, which can eventually lead to hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency and death . Some forms are known to be associated with environmental exposures (e.g. asbestos), drug toxicity, radiation exposure, or collagen vascular diseases (e.g. scleroderma). Previous studies have focused on the association between IIP and the MUC5B, TERT, and TERC genes. MUC5B encodes mucin 5B, expressed in mucus-producing cells in the distal airways of the lung. Lung tissue from individuals with IIP has higher concentrations of MUC5B than controls. TERT and TERC are involved in the maintenance of telomere lengths, and mutations in these genes are associated with shortened telomeres in the alveolar epithelia.The recently discovered association with the DSP locus suggests that changes in cell-cell adhesion may also play a role in IIP. Desmosomes (and desmoplakin) are important in maintaining the integrity of tissues that experience mechanical stress (such as the peripheral portions of the lung), and there is strong evidence that perturbation of the desmosome disrupts epithelial homeostasis . Mutations in DSP have also been associated with other diseases that involve loss of tissue integrity, such as in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia , keratodermas , and alopecia .   rs28931610, also known as R2366C or Arg2366C, is a SNP in the desmoplakin DSP gene on chromosome 6.The disabling keratoderma known as skin fragility-woolly hair syndrome (SFWHS) can be caused by either inheriting two copies of the rs28931610(T) allele or one copy plus another DSP gene mutation on the other chromosomal strand.This variant meets the criteria published in 2013 by the ACMG regarding incidental findings in exome or genome sequencing, as a variant that they do recommend informing a patient about.",,,SNPedia

G6PD codes for the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which helps protect the cell from oxidative damage. Depending on genotype, an individual may possess one or two primary versions of the G6PD gene; type A and type B. Type A is predominantly found in people who have African ancestry. Mutations of G6PD can cause varying degrees of G6PD deficiency, which is a disease affecting red blood cells. For example, an G to A substitution mutation at the rs1050828 (also referred to as G202A) is associated with a reduction of G6PD.  The G6PD deficient genotype A- (~8-20% reduction of G6PD) is typically defined by the possession of the rs1050828 A allele (rs1050828(A;A)).  In addition, individuals who are type A- almost always possess the rs1050829 G allele. G6PD deficiency frequency is highest in malarial regions where G6PD deficient individuals are typically less affected by malarial infection ().  Also, the literature suggests that there is association between the rs1050828 locus and various red blood cell traits in African Americans.A 2019 publication reports that this variant also has the effect of lowering HbA1c values by ~0.88%-units in hemizygous men and 0.34%-units in heterozygous women. The authors suggest that when using Hb1Ac values to diagnose type-2 diabetes, those units should be added to the measured Hb1Ac level, and a diagnosis should then be made if the sum is >6.5% (the standard diagnostic threshold).   A total of 72 SNPs were genotyped in two populations in eastern Sudan (Hausa and Massalit), as well as, a cohort of malaria hospital patients and a control sample set (n=449).  The study found that in comparison to controls (n=69), Massalit individuals (n=60) who possess the rs105828 A allele were less susceptible to malarial infection (P=0.04). Study surveyed 49,094 SNPs (covering ~2,100 candidate genes)in Caucasian (n=23,439) and African American (n=7,112) individuals from five different population cohorts.  Genome wide association results include that rs1050828 A allele found in African American individuals is strongly associated with certain erythrocyte phenotypes including; lower red blood cell, hemoglobin and hematocrit counts (all p values <2.0 x 10 <sup>-13</sup>). In order to identify SNPs associated with different red blood cell phenotypic traits a genome-wide association study was conducted on African Americans (n=16,500). The SNP rs1050828 was found to be associated with hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and RBC count. A cohort of African American medical patients (n=1904) was analyzed in a genome-wide association study where loci were correlated with certain red blood cell traits.  The rs1050828 locus is associated with RBC count (P=4x10<sup>-13</sup>), mean corpuscular volume (P=1x10<sup>-14</sup>), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (P=9x10<sup>-9</sup>). rs1050829 is a SNP within the G6PD gene and is located the X chromosome. G6PD codes for the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which helps protect the cell from oxidative damage.  Depending on genotype, an individual may possess one of two primary versions of the G6PD gene; type A and type B. Type A is predominantly found in people who have African ancestry.  Mutations of G6PD can cause varying degrees of G6PD deficiency, which is a disease affecting red blood cells.  For example, an A to G substitution mutation at the rs1050829 locus (also known as A376G) is associated with reduced production of G6PD enzyme. Other mutations causing G6PD deficiency include; rs1050828. The G6PD deficient genotype A- (~8-20% reduction of G6PD) is typically defined by the possession of both the rs1050829 G allele and the rs1050828 A allele. G6PD deficiency frequency is highest in malarial regions where G6PD deficient individuals are typically less affected by malarial infection ().The minor allele of this SNP should be reclassified as benign according to  Study of malaria in Gambian children uses the rs1050829 allele to help detect G6PD deficient individuals.  A total of 72 SNPs were genotyped in two populations in eastern Sudan (Hausa and Massalit), as well as, a cohort of malaria hospital patients and a control sample set (n=449).  The study found that in comparison to controls (n=69), Massalit individuals (n=60) who possess the rs105829 G allele were less susceptible to malarial infection (p=0.02). In a G6PD deficient Jordanian clinical population, the A376G allele was found to be at a frequency of 21% in males (n=47) and 9% in females (n=16).

hsa,MDM2,"rs117039649, also known as SNP285 or SNP285C, is a SNP in an intron of the MDM2 p53 binding protein homolog gene.This SNP appears to only be found (so far) in Caucasians, and, in a subset of the alleles carrying the SNP309G>C (rs2279744) variant. A 2011 study comparing MDM2 promoter status among different cohorts of ovarian cancer (n = 1993) and breast cancer (n = 1973) patients concluded that rs117039649(C) carriers were at reduced risk for both ovarian (odds ratio 0.74, CI: 0.58-0.94) and breast (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.62-1.00) cancer compared to SNP309G carriers (lacking SNP285).   rs2279744, a variant in the promoter of the MDM2 gene and also known as ""-410T-G"", ""SNP309"", and ""SNP309T>G"", has been studied for several years to determine it's role in cancer origin and treatment. The interest primarily stems from the ability of the MDM2 protein to bind to and thereby enhance the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein known as p53. Studies on rs2279744 include:* rs2279744(G) carriers in individuals with cancer tend to develop such cancers on average 12 years earlier than those lacking this allele, and the frequency of rs2279744(G) was greatly increased in those who developed soft tissue sarcomas at a young age. * Individuals with one or more rs2279744(G) alleles who are also carriers of the TP53 rs1042522(C) (arg at aa72) SNP tend to develop cancers earlier than rs2279744(T;T) homozygotes who carry the same p53 SNP. * rs2279744(T;T) individuals who have a mutant p53 (in their tumors) are at an increased risk of death (risk ratio RR of death = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.08 to 5.03). Tumor p53 status was not associated with breast cancer survival among rs2279744(G;T) or rs2279744(G;G) genotypes. * rs2279744 showed no association with nonsmall cell lung cancer risk in a study of 1,787 Caucasian patients. However, a possible association between nonsmoking (G;G) homozygotes and a higher risk of nonsmall cell lung cancer was reported.* A study in Chinese leukemia patients found that the rs2279744(G) allele was unexpectedly associated with reduced risk.* Another study concludes that this SNP on its own has little or no effect on the risk of common cancers, but it might modify the time of tumor onset and prognosis. * rs2279744(G;G) females are at a 2.76x increased risk (CI: 1.06-7.20, p=0.03) for endometrial cancer compared to (G;T) or (T;T) genotypes based on a study of 73 patients and matched controls.* A study of 148 individuals with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing first-line chemotherapy, such as the irinotecan plus cisplatin regimen, concluded after multivariate analysis that the rs2279744(T;T) genotype was independently predictive for longer survival (HR = 1.742, p = .032). * The rs2279744(G;G) genotype was associated with high grade breast cancer tumors (with an odds ratio of 1.64, CI:1.06-2.53, p=0.025) and greater nodal involvement (OR=2.51, CI:1.26-4.98, p=0.009), but was not associated with an earlier age of cancer diagnosis or even risk of breast cancer, in a study of ~300 Scottish Caucasian patients.* Around 300 cases each of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma were studied relative to this SNP. No significant associations were found between rs2279744 and any of these three types of skin cancer. However, compared with the (T;T) genotype, the adjusted odds ratios of having moles on the arms for (G;T) and (G;G) genotypes was 0.92 (CI: 0.78-1.08) and 0.68 (CI: 0.53-0.87), respectively (p, trend, 0.005).* rs2279744(G;G) women are diagnosed with melanoma 13 years earlier than women who carry one or no G alleles. Note that this SNP does not cause higher risk of melanoma; it affects only the age at diagnosis of melanoma in women and has no effect in men, as reported in the 23andMe blog / 23andMe blog.* Odds ratio for (G;G) 3x, for (G;T) 2x, for breast cancer in a study of 124 Taiwanese patients, along with a correlation towards earlier occurence.* rs117039649, also known as SNP285C, a second MDM2 SNP found on the SNP305G allele (and only in Caucasians), reduces the risk of both ovarian and breast cancer among SNP309G holders (odds ratio 0.74 and 0.79, respectively), compared to SNP309G holders lacking this (second) SNP./ 23andMe blog rs2279744(G) has been associated with earlier onset for some cancers, including soft tissue sarcoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in women, and decreased survival in people with stomach and kidney cancer.  But there is evidence for improved survival in women with ovarian cancer who have the G version of this SNP.  Paradoxically, higher levels of the MDM2 protein (as would be expected with the G version of SNP rs2279744 shown to lead to earlier melanoma onset in the current study) have been associated with improved survival for melanoma.* rs2279744 is not associated with SLE in a study of Caucasians, African-Americans, and Asian children and adults.* rs2279744, rs1042522, rs17878362 and rs1625895 associated with high grade endometrial cancer      Haplotype structure and selection of the MDM2 oncogene in humans.

hsa,ABCC11,"rs17822931, also known as c.538G>A or G180R, is a SNP in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 11 ABCC11 gene. The ABCC11 protein helps transport small molecules across apical membranes such as those in apocrine secretory cells.  This SNP determines wet vs dry earwax as well as sweat production, and it is also associated with lipid secretion. It is commonly (T;T) for East Asians and (C;C) for Europeans and Africans. A study of deodorant usage in a large (17,000+) population showed that rs17822931(T;T) individuals were at least 5-fold less likely to use deodorant, consistent with them being ""genotypically nonodorous"". Although not statistically significant, there was some evidence for a heterozygote effect, implying that individuals with a (C;C) genotype for this SNP were likely to use deodorant at a higher frequency than (C;T) genotypes. gnxp indicates this SNP influences risk of breast cancer in Japanese women.

hsa,SMAD6,"'''rs12913975''' is an A/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the SMAD6 gene that has been associated with the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The most common nucleotide or 'major allele' of this SNP is G, which is also the dominant allele. The minor allele is A, which according to data from the 1000 Genomes project occurs in the sampled population at a frequency of 15.8% (observed 345 times in 2183 people). HapMap data (July 2005) from 1208 individuals from 13 populations included population specific genotype frequencies for this SNP  dbSNP.A 2011 study published by Li ''et al.'' examined 33 SNPs in 13 TGF-beta pathway genes to estimate the effect of genotype on brain metastasis in 116 NSCLC patients. The authors found that NSCLC patients with the G/G genotype of the rs12913975 SNP had a significantly increased risk of brain metastasis compared to patients with the A/G genotype over the two years following initial time of lung cancer diagnosis (hazard risk: 2.540, 95% confidence interval: 1.204-5.359, p = 0.014). Hazard ratios and confidence intervals were estimated using cox proportional hazards model for the multivariate survival analyses adjusted for sex, age, clinical stage, tumor histology, Karnofsky performance status, and smoking status. A two-tailed t- test was used to determine significance of associations. This finding may allow clinicians to use the rs12913975 SNP as a measure of an NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of developing brain metastasis. It is not known whether this SNP plays a functional role in the potential of NSCLC tumors to metastasize to the brain. However, the SNP is located in the SMAD6 gene, an inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling that is a pathway affected in different cancers, so this may in fact be a functional variant  PMID: 23284751.In 2011 Lin ''et al.'' determined the effect of genotype on survival in 598 advanced-stage NSCLC patients across 227 SNPs in 23 TGF-beta pathway-related genes to estimate. The authors identified the rs12913975 SNP as a genetic variant significantly associated with the overall survival of NSCLC patients (hazard risk: 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.59, p = 0.01). Furthermore, they found that the G/G allele of this SNP had a significant positive effect on the survival of NSCLC patients using chemoradiation (hazard risk: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.90, p = 0.01), but that this trend was not significant when patients used only chemotherapy (hazard risk: 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.56-1.02, p = 0.29). Hazard ratios and confidence intervals were estimated using cox proportional hazards model for the multivariate survival analyses adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, clinical stager, pretreatment PS, and therapy modality.

Rs10766071 has been associated with shorter sleep duration as measured by polysomnography&#8212; a method for recording the activity of the brain, eyes, muscles, and heart while the subject sleeps. The A allele (major allele) is associated with higher sleep duration and the G allele (minor allele) is associated with shorter sleep duration (n=414). However, only one individual with the GG genotype was in the study. G is the ancestral allele and is also the minor variant (frequency = .0851) (dbSNP).ARNTL encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS domain transcription factor (PMID:11163178).Studies have shown that ARNTL is an important component of the transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) which regulates circadian rhythms. Homozygous ARNTL null mutant mice loose circadian rhythmicity, as measured by activity patterns, when transferred to constant darkness, demonstrating that ARNTL plays a key role in maintaining circadian rhythmicity (PMID:11163178). Rs1076671 was one of 13 significant SNPs (after Bonferroni correction) discovered by Kripke et al. (PMID:25660813) to be associated with sleep variables. Their study consisted of a cohort of patients of likely European ancestry who were recruited from a &#8220;busy academic sleep practice.&#8221; Patients consisted mostly of individuals who had been given a tentative diagnosis of sleep apnea, and had been sent for a polysomnography to confirm. All patients were 21 years or older.The authors of the paper collected DNA samples from the patients and then performed custom Illumina golden gate assay for 768 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This subset of SNPs was chosen because they were relevant to circadian rhythm regulation. Patients were surveyed about their sleep schedule and habits and polysomnographs were recorded of each patient. Thirty-eight phenotypic measures were analyzed. The authors performed linear or logistic regression analyses and then performed a Bonferroni correction for the total number of SNPs tested. The p-value for this association was 5.3x10-5 prior to Bonferroni correction. Importantly, this SNP is not genome-wide significant.  References: Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP).

That means it doesn't change the nature of the TGF-β1 protein, but it does change the amount produced. The T version increases the amount of TGF-β1 produced, by preventing AP1 from binding to this region where in the C version it would normally downregulate production. That increased TGF-β1 production with the T version is probably what causes all the health effects of this SNP.  Whether increased TGF-β1 is good or bad probably depends on the disease you are interested in.It has been associated with increased risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although smoking is the main risk factor, smokers with a rs1800469(C) allele (or 2 other TGFB1 SNPs, rs1982073 and rs2241712) were more likely to develop COPD, based on a study of ~700 Caucasian subjects Although based on a relatively small number of patients, a 2018 study concluded that women with breast cancer receiving radiation who carry a rs1800469(T) allele are at ~4x higher risk of radiation-induced fibrosis (scarring) and related poor cosmetic outcomes compared to women who are rs1800469(C;C). Formerly known as the very well studied rs1982073 rs1800471 encodes a change at codon 25 of the TGFB1 gene. It is reported to predispose several organs to fibrosis, and in relation to Crohn's disease, it was associated with stricturing Crohn's disease (odds ratio 2.63, CI: 1.16-5.88, p=0.01) and a shorter time to intestinal resection (p = 0.06) in a study of several hundred Australian patients.  This snp has been merged into Rs1800470rs1982073, also known as codon 10, +10T/C or T869C, a SNP in the first exon of the transforming growth factor beta1 TGFB1 gene, has been implicated in a wide variety of disorders, presumably connected through the role TGFB1 plays in suppressing the immune system.The L10P allele of rs1982073 is associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer.  The rs1982073(T) allele, generally associated with lower levels of TGFB1 protein production, has been associated with increased risk for the following:*Allograft rejection** The rs1982073(T) allele is associated with increased risk for subclinical allograft rejection with an odds ratio of 6.7 (p = 0.02). *Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** Although smoking is the main risk factor, smokers with a rs1982073(T) allele (or two other TGFB1 SNPs, rs2241712 and rs1800469) were more likely to develop COPD, based on a study of ~700 Caucasian subjects. *Cytopenia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)**rs1982073(T;T) homozygosity was associated with a severe degree of cytopenia (odds ratio 4.9, p = 0.0071) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), even though the genotype apparently does not predispose individuals to the disease. *Diabetes**A study of 400 Caucasians with type 1 diabetes found an increased risk for diabetic nephropathy for carriers of rs1982073(T) alleles. *Pre-eclampsia and stillbirth**Although not associated with the overall risk, among women who developed eclampsia/pre-eclampsia with severe renal and neurological complications or had neonatal deaths/still births, the rs1982073(T) allele was more likely in a relatively small study (< 100 patients). *Sarcoidosis and chronic beryllium disease**Although not associated with overall risk for developing the diseases, the rs1982073(T) allele was associated with the severity of granulomatous diseases such as chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and sarcoidosis, and a haplotype containing rs1982073(C) was protective against severe disease. On the other hand (strand?), the less common rs1982073(C) allele, generally associated with lower levels of TGFB1 protein production, has been associated with increased risk as follows:*The rs1982073(C) allele was significantly more frequent in patients with two Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-related diseases, specifically, primary acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH), than in controls (p<0.001). *Alzheimer's disease**Both the rs1982073(C) allele and the (C;C) genotype were overrepresented in a study of ~200 patients compared to controls, independently of ApoE4 status. The (C;C) genotype was also overrepresented in patients progressing from MCI (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's, suggesting that TGFB1 may be an early marker of inflammatory mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's. *Brucellosis**A study of ~400 Iranian patients with brucellosis found that the rs1982073(C) allele was associated with increased risk. *Diabetes**A study of 400 Caucasians with type-2 diabetes determined that rs1982073(C) was associated with diabetic nephropathy, and even more strongly with diabetic retinopathy; the odds ratio patients with retinopathy but not nephropathy versus uncomplicated diabetes was 3.17 (CI: 2.17-4.63), and the different results between type-2 diabetes and type-1 diabetes were potentially ascribed to population differences. *Myopia**A study of 200 highly nearsighted Chinese Taiwanese found that people with the rs1982073(C;C) genotype were more likely to have high myopia compared to the (C;T) or (T;T) genotypes. The odds ratio was 1.83 (CI: 1.27-2.63, p<0.001). *Prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**The rs1982073(C) allele was associated with a higher risk of developing prostate cancer as well as benign  prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a study of 175 Brazilian patients, with odds ratio compared to the population of 2.6x and 3.6x, respectively. *Ulcer**The rs1982073(C) allele was associated with risk for gastric ulcer with an odds ratio of 1.76 (CI: 1.12-2.77) in a study of 377 Russian patients. *Patients homozygous for rs1982073(C) were at greatest risk (odds ratio 7.7, p=0.03) for graft versus host disease (GVD) after heart transplantation. *Ovarian cancer**  showed '''no association''' with ovarian cancer risk 4,624 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 8,113 controls of white non-Hispanic origin ovarian cancer Genetic polymorphisms in the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathways and breast cancer risk and survival. an association of (C) with hypertension in rheumatoid arthritis patients rs1982073 chemoradiotherapy (C;C) and (C;T) were associated with a better disease-free and overall survival when compared with the low-producer TT genotype (hazard ratios for interaction 3.42, 95% CI 1.12-10.5 and 3.09, 95% CI 0.96-10.0, respectively)  rs2241712, a SNP in the promoter region of the transforming growth factor beta1 TGFB1 gene has been associated with increased risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Together with rs9527025 (C370S), which it co-segregates with, a haplotype (""KL-VS"") has been described that is reported to increase klotho secretion and may alter its functions; the alternative haplotype is named KL-FC (due to the F from F352V and C from C370S). The klotho protein is a hormone found primarily in the kidney and choroid plexus of the brain. At the genetic level, the Klotho gene is reported to affect longevity in mice  and perhaps humans , and KL-VS heterozygosity (but not homozygosity) has been associated with greater brain cortical volume . At the protein level, older adults with higher plasma klotho concentrations tend to show lower less decline with age on standardized cognitive tests , adults with higher stress tend to have lower plasma klotho levels , and transgenic mice bred to have excess human amyloid precursor protein (to simulate Alzheimer's disease) score better on some tests when their klotho levels are increased .Most of the studies cited above for studies of klotho in humans should be considered preliminary for at least two reasons: they are not based on large sample sizes, and, they haven't been replicated by independent investigators. In addition, there is a report showing no difference in the klotho plasma levels between FC/FC and FC/VS individuals , as well as a report showing KL-VS heterozygotes had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers , in contrast to the studies cited above.

hsa,MET,"rs1858830, located in promoter of the MET gene, was originally reported in 2006 as being linked to a 2x increase in the risk of autism based on a study of ~700 families. From  OMIM 164860: ""In case-control analysis, the relative risk for autism was 2.27 for the CC genotype and 1.67 for the GC genotype compared to the GG genotype.""However, since 2006, there have been several studies unable to replicate this association, as well as some replicating the finding, at least to varying degrees. These include:* Those replicating to some degree the association with autism:** : 2008 study with 100 families, from the same group that published the original 2006 association** : 2009 study, reports odds ratio of 1.64 for C allele for autism association * Those finding no association of rs1858830 to autism:** : 2009 study with 300+ families** : 2010 study of 126 Japanese families** : 2011 study of Chinese families The association of rs1858830 in the MET gene with autism failed to replicate in 325 multiplex families and 10 trios of the International Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC), although another MET SNP did associate with autism (rs38845) Disruption of cerebral cortex MET signaling in autism spectrum disorder. Distinct genetic risk based on association of MET in families with co-occurring autism and gastrointestinal conditions. Association of genetic variation in the MET proto-oncogene with schizophrenia and general cognitive ability. Further evidence for the role of MET in autism susceptibility.  Rs2237717 (major: C, minor: T) is located in intron 11 within the MET proto-oncogene. The MET gene is primarily known to be involved in tumor metastasis . However, MET has also been shown to have roles in general neurodevelopment  and in the development of autism .  Rs2237717 has been linked to schizophrenia, ability to recognize facial emotion, and chronic rhinosinusitis. ==Association with schizophrenia and cognitive ability== Given that schizophrenic patients have a lower incidence of cancer despite more exposure to risk factors and relatives without schizophrenia appear to also have a protective effect on cancer incidence, it has been hypothesized that alterations in cancer genes (like MET, containing rs2237717) may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia . ===Schizophrenia===In a study by Burdick et al  which investigated the relation between SNPs in MET gene and schizophrenia, it was found that rs2237717 resided in an enriched haplotype of one of the four haplotype blocks. The &#8216;Block 3&#8217; haplotype was the most commonly underrepresented in the schizophrenia case group (p = 2.5e-4, OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24&#8212;0.65). Rs2237717 was one of three SNPs in the haplotype block to survive correction with permutation (p = 0.002), with 37.9% of the cases and 49.6% of the controls showing the ancestral allele (C). The ancestral allele is thus considered a protective allele against schizophrenia. This test was replicated by the authors using a dominant model and the results remained significant (p = 0.001). These results represent the first report of an association between MET and schizophrenia and the second of an association of MET with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric illness (autism, . ===General cognitive ability===They also reported that the MET haplotype which was inversely correlated with schizophrenia (&#8216;Block 3&#8217; containing rs2237717) had a significant impact on neurocognition. Carriers of the major allele at rs2237717 in the comparison group performed significantly better than non-carriers on a test of general cognitive ability.==Association with facial emotional perception==Another study by Lin et al  showed the rs2237717 SNP is associated with facial emotional perception.  The CT and CC genotypes enhanced facial emotional perception as compared to those with the TT genotype (ANOVA p = 0.016 and GLM p = 0.018, controlled for age, gender, and education). There was also an interaction of rs2237717 with rs1130233 in the AKT gene in the same signaling pathway, in which the rs2237717 C carrier/ rs1130233 G carrier group showed better facial emotional perception than those with the TT/AA genotype (ANOVA p = 0.035 and GLM p = 0.015), controlled for neurocognitive functions. According to the authors, this is the first study to suggest that genetic factors can affect performance of facial emotion perception.==Association with chronic rhinosinusitis==The MET gene has been implicated in nasal polyp development , and Castano et al  showed that the minor allele at rs2237717 is associated with chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with nasal polyps (genotypic P nominal = 0.09, empirical P = 0.04, OR = 1.4, CI = 1.0-1.9). This suggests that polymorphisms in the MET gene, including rs2237717, may play a role in the susceptibility to develop CRS. Study findings apply to patients with nasal polyps and severe CRS unresponsive to surgery.       rs38845 is a SNP in the first intron of the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase of the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor MET gene. rs38845 is associated with autism (p < 0.004) in a study of 325 multiplex International Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) families and 10 trios  MET and autism susceptibility: family and case-control studies.

Allelic heterogeneity at the serotonin transporter locus (SLC6A4) confers susceptibility to autism and rigid-compulsive behaviors. According to David Hinds of 23andMe on community forums, ""nearly everyone (99.97%) is getting called as CC, and there is no clear heterozygote cluster"" ... ""the genotype calls for rs25531 on our platform are not meaningful."" Looking at OpenSNP frequency data, this seems to be universal for direct to consumer genotyping services at this stage.The minor allele (G) of rs25531 is almost always in phase with the long (L) allele of the 5-HTTLPR, which is the most commonly studied variation in this region. The (L) long allele may be associated with lower levels of serotonin.The article and video from ""The Atlantic"" suggests that children with the short allele (A), may need and benefit greatly from more maternal support* contrast to earlier reports linking rs25531, a SNP in the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 gene, to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), a March 2007 publication finds no significant association studying ""the largest sample size of OCD patients (N=347) and controls (N=749) ever investigated"". A separate study of 75 patients suffering mood disorders after traumatic brain injury (TBI) concluded that there was no evidence of association between rs25531 and depression post-TBI.A small study (62 patients and 62 matched controls) investigated this SNP in relation to blushing. (Blushing is considered to be one of the prime pathophysiological markers of social anxiety disorder.) The less active 5-HTTLPR genotypes were nominally significantly associated with increased blushing propensity in patients with social anxiety disorder, and association remained significant even when statistically controlled for he influence of depression.A study of 94 depressed patients who attempted suicide compared to 94 without psychiatric disorders found no evidence of an association with rs25531.A study of 97 ""normal"" individuals concluded that rs25531(G;G) individuals selectively process positive affective material alongside selective avoidance of negative affective material, in a manner absent among individuals carrying a rs25531(A) allele. To put it another way, if this conclusion drawn from a very small sample of people can be replicated, rs25531(G;G) individuals may have a tendency to be optimists and to be more resilient to stress.A study published in 2011 of 2,500+ individuals followed from 1995 - 2008 as part of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health found that twice as many respondents with two 5-HTTLPR long variants said they were very satisfied with life compared with carriers of two short versions. Conversely, 26% of those carrying two short alleles said they were dissatisfied with life, compared with 20% of people carrying two long variants. This  blog post investigates the statistics.A study of 135 patients with major depressive disorder (mean age 31.1+/-11.6 years, 68% females) treated with escitalopram 10-20 mg/day for 12 weeks concluded that patients carrying the rs25531(A) allele may be at increased risk for side effects (e.g. headaches), but they say no associations with efficacy. Protocol for genotyping rs25531 rs25532 is a SNP in a regulatory region upstream of the serotonin transporter  SLC6A4 gene. The more common allele, rs25532(C), is the higher-expressing allele.A study of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) concluded that the major allele of rs25532 was a major contributor to the association of a corresponding haplotype with this disorder.

The haplotype A-A-G for SNPs rs3794808, rs140701 and rs4583306 has a 1.7x increased risk for panic disorder.  This SNP represents a polymorphic region consisting of an ""in/del"", i.e. either an insertion or a deletion, of 43 or 44 nucleotides. This SNP is commonly known as the 5-HTTLPR variant of the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 gene. The deletion allele is referred to as the ""S"" allele, the insertion allele is known as the ""L"" allele, and hence the genotypes are usually called the LL, SL, and SS genotypes in publications. Note, however, that this is actually a tri-allelic SNP, in that on occasion, a single nucleotide, usually a G, may be present at this position.This SNP has been studied in many contexts, including the following:* Anxiety related behaviours and disorders* Depression** Response to anti-depressant drugs* Seasonality and seasonal affective disorder* Suicide* Premature ejaculation** Men with the LL genotype ejaculate about twice as quickly as men with SS or SL genotypes on average, based on a study of 89 Dutch men who suffer from the primary form of premature ejaculation.  * Attention deficit disorder* Migraine* Bipolar mood disorder* Obsessive compulsive disorder* Fibromyalgia* Irritable bowel syndromeIt is beyond the current scope to summarize all the associations seen for this SNP, as well as the lack of replication reported in some follow-on studies.

Alcohol and aggressive behavior in men--moderating effects of oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) polymorphisms.   rs53576 is a silent G to A change in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with the G allele are more empathetic, feel less lonely, employ more sensitive parenting techniques, and have lower rates of autism (discussed in )The blog / Not Exactly Rocket Science discusses that Americans with (G;G) tend to be more sensitive parents, more empathetic and less lonely than those with an &#8216;A&#8217;. In a Korean population people with (G;G) were less likely to seek support from their peers.  Culture, distress, and oxytocin receptor polymorphism (OXTR) interact to influence emotional support seeking. Oxytocin receptor genetic variation relates to empathy and stress reactivity in humans. In brief, people with the G;G genotype were better able to discern the emotional state of others than those who carried the A-allele (/ blog summary found here).  The study encompassed 192 participants of both sexes and mixed ethnicities. The study subjects underwent a number of tests to determine their level of empathy and stress reactivity. They found that G;G individuals performed significantly better on the behavioral measure of empathy and were 22.7% less likely to make a mistake on the ""Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test"" (RMET) (a behavioural measure of empathic accuracy) than A;A/A;G individuals (P = 0.005). Similarly, G;G individuals reported higher levels of dispositional empathy than A;A/A;G individuals: mean (SE) = 3.69 (0.06) and 3.53 (0.04) for G;G and A;A/A;G, respectively (P = 0.025), and were less affected by stress (as measured by their heart rates): mean (SE) = 72.1 (0.54) and 78.4 (1.19) for G;G and A;A/A;G, respectively. Associations between the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and affect, loneliness and intelligence in normal subjects. This study examined the association between the OXTR gene and parenting. A total of 176 mothers of toddlers were included in the study. After controlling for marital discord, depression, and education status, rs53576 was found to significantly correlate with parenting, with the G;G genotype being associated with a significantly more sensitive parenting style than A;A or A;G genotypes. However, they concluded that the major factor influencing parenting was the maternal education level. Forty-five female subjects (17 twin pairs and 11 twins without their sibling) were genotyped and tested for their ability to hear and understand conversations in noisy environments. Participants with the G;G genotype reported less difficulty hearing and understanding (difficulty hearing total score Mean (SD), 9.2 (4.2)) than participants with A;A/A;G genotypes (13.9 (3.8); p < 0.001). Even after adjusting for age, the relationship between genotype and difficulty hearing scores was still significant (p = 0.003). Two hundred three healthy German male university students (mean age 23.2 y, SD 2.9 y) were subjected to a mock interview and their saliva cortisol levels were tested before and at a number of time points after the interview. Half of the participants were told to bring a female friend as social support, whereas the other half came alone to the interview. The authors found that subjects carrying the G allele (G;G or A;G genotypes) had significantly lower cortisol responses to stress when they had social support (P < 0.01). Conversely, there were no differences in cortisol levels in subjects with the A;A genotype receiving or not receiving social support (P = 0.46). Moreover, there was a trend (P = 0.08) for people with the A;A genotype to display higher levels of cortisol throughout the session than G carriers (no differences between the genotypes were observed at baseline)./ 23andMe blog discusses the snp./ blogs.scientificamerican discusses the snp. In this study, 345 healthy subjects were examined by multimodal neuroimaging techniques to identify structural and functional alterations in OXTR risk allele carriers and their link to temperament. The authors found that there was a significant association between the different rs53576 genotypes and grey matter volume in the hypothalamus, with the hypothalamus volume being significantly larger in G;G carriers than in A;A carriers (P = 0.012). Moreover, they investigated the relationship between rs53576 and reward dependence (RD) using the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, and found that the G;G, G;A, and A;A genotypes were associated with the highest, intermediate, and lowest RD values, respectively (G;G vs. A;A, p=0.02; A;G vs. A;A, p=0.07). Lastly, they also demonstrated that rs53576 is associated with amygdala activation, with the A;A genotype being associated with a significant reduction in activation compared to the G;G genotype (p=0.036); and with the functional relationship between the amygdala and the hypothalamus, with A;A carrier having a significantly increased functional correlation (p=0.036). The authors concluded that there is likely a neural mechanism linking both structural and neural signalling alterations in the oxytocinergic system to individual differences in emotional reactivity and prosocial temperament. This study found that there is no association between rs53576 variants and the risk of autism in Caucasian children and adolescents.Followup:",,,SNPedia

UGT1A1*28 duplication allele inserts a seventh (TA) pair to six (TA) pairs this reducing the activity to 30% of normal.See the following SNPs, which have been merged to rs3064744 on dbSNP:rs34815109rs35600288  Although the insertion is supposed to be the minor allele, the majority of FTDNA v2 and 23andMe v2 results show II as the result, so use caution when interpreting this result.rs34815109 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers. These risks include:* An increased risk for breast cancer is reported in premenopausal African-American women, based on a study of 200 women. The reported odds ratio was 1.8 (CI: 1.0-3.1, p=0.06) for carriers of one or more UGT1A1*28 alleles.* In colorectal cancer patients being treated with irinotecan, adverse side effects (neutropenia and/or severe diarrhea) are reported to be strongly associated with the number of UGT1A1*28 alleles. Patients homozygous for the *28 allele are 3.5 times more likely to develop severe neutropenia compared with individuals with the wild genotype. The FDA has approved a genetic test for UGT1A1 status to be used to determine dosage when considering irinotecan therapy  FDA press release. However, no prospective study has examined whether a reduced dose of irinotecan results in a reduced rate of adverse drug events.* Hyperbilirubinemia, a potentially toxic increase in bilirubin levels, is possible among rs34815109(TA;TA) individuals treated with the drug tranilast.The three other SNPs that describe the same polymorphism are:* rs34983651* rs35600288* rs5839491  rs34983651 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene; the primary entry in SNPedia for this set of SNPs is at rs34815109.

In general, based on Promethease user data, it appears as if Ancestry's v2c and v2d chips interpret the normal allele as ""D"", whereas 23andMe v2-v4 chips interpret it as ""I"". These chips (v2-v4) appear to have false negatives for this SNP, and this SNP is not reported on the v5 chip.    rs35600288 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene; the primary entry in SNPedia for this set of SNPs is at rs34815109.The other two SNPs (besides rs34815109) that also describe the same polymorphism are:* rs34983651* rs5839491 aka c.-1352A= (and probably also c.-1353A=)The ""A"" variant (T in dbSNP orientation) has been observed in a few Japanese newborns with hyperbilirubinemia, but the association is hardly causative, and even the authors conclude the pathogenicity is ""uncertain"".

The rs1061170(T) allele encodes the more common Tyr (Y), while the generally rarer rs1061170(C) encodes the His (H).This SNP has been associated primarily with age related macular degeneration, and to a lesser extent, with longevity.This  research paper shows that CFH Y402H is the relevant mutation. A haplotype of rs1061170 rs3753394 rs800292 rs1329428 (TGTC) was found to confer a significantly increased likelihood of exudative AMD. rs1061170 (aka Y402H 1277 T>C) was not associated with exudative AMD.CFH variations appear to contribute to ARMD in Caucasians, but not in Japanese CFH variant rs1061170 Y402H is strongly associated with both dry and wet AMD rs1061170(C) alleles are significantly associated with increased susceptibility to early AMD in Taiwan Chinese populations.Some SNPs in other genes (like C7 and MBL2) may protect individuals with one or two of the rs1061170(C) risk alleles.  An analysis of the joint effects of rs1061170, rs11200638 and rs10490924 on AMDIn a 4 year study of longevity of 491 nonagenarians in the Finnish Vitality 90+ study, risk factor-adjusted mortality was significantly higher among the rs1061170(C) carriers compared to non-carriers (odds ratio 1.78, CI 1.19-2.67, p = 0.005), and the survival curves of these carriers and non-carriers deviated significantly (p = 0.016). In other words, in this study, rs1061170(T;T) individuals generally lived longer than (C) allele carriers. age related macular degeneration   Each copy of the less common T version of this SNP was associated with about 36% lower odds of meningococcal disease.   rs11200638, a SNP in the HTRA1 promoter, is associated with a 10 fold increased risk of wet age related macular degeneration in Japanese  and Caucasian  populations.

The genotype at highest risk is (A;A).Note, most studies have shown that that this SNP is highly predictive (i.e. is in near perfect (D'>0.98) linkage disequilibrium) with rs10490924, thus the status of one very closely predicts the status of the other.  However, one Caucasian AMD study reported the linkage disequilibrium measure for these two SNPs on 10q26, (i.e., rs10490924, which is upstream of HTRA1 in LOC387715/ARMS2, and rs11200638) as D'=0.8, and all four possible haplotypes of the two SNPs were detected in the samples.  Further, this same study reported that these two SNPs appear to contribute equally to the risk of AMD (both GA and CNV) and show no evidence of interaction with CFH .A 2011 meta-analysis concluded that rs11200638(A;G) and (A;A) carriers had 2.243 and 8.669 times the risk of developing AMD, respectively, when compared with those who carry the (G;G) genotype. rs10490924 and rs11200638 defined 2 significant haplotypes associated with increased risk of neovascular AMD. show that rs11200638 has no significant impact on HTRA1 promoter activity in three different cell lines, and HTRA1 mRNA expression exhibits no significant change between control and AMD retinas A study of 95 Taiwanese Chinese confirms rs11200638(A) allele risk for both wet and dry forms of AMD, with heterozygote odds ratio of 1.97 CI:0.81-4.81, homozygote OR = 8.59 CI: 3.28-22.49, p=6.7x10<sup>-3</sup> for an additive allele-dosage model. A study of Chinese AMD patients reports a 7.6x increased risk for rs11200638(A), and finds that smoking almost doubles the risk, to 15.7x increased risk.

hsa,FCGR3A,"rs396991 is a SNP in the Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIIa, receptor (CD16a) FCGR3A gene. rs396991(T) encodes the phenylalanine (F) allele, with the (G) allele encoding the variant valine (V). The (V) isoform is considered high-binding to IgG1 and IgG3, while the (F) isoform is considered low-binding. This SNP is known in the literature by many names, including A559C, T559G, 158F/V, and 176F/V.What's the importance of this? FcgRIIIa stimulatory receptors are expressed by most cells in the immune system, including monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, platelets and endothelial cells, as well as a subpopulation of T-cells. FcgR isoforms have been linked to the pathogenic consequences triggered by autoantibodies or immune complexes in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as to the efficacy of some immunotherapeutic treatments such as rituximab.Many studies have been published about this FCGR3A SNP, roughly divided by either disorder or treatment as follows:* HIV to AIDs, including susceptibility and progression:** In a study of 2 cohorts of men infected with HIV, the rs396991(T;T) (ie F/F) genotype was underrepresented in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, whereas the heterozygous genotype was associated with its development. A similar association was observed between rs396991 genotypes and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) seropositivity.* Crohn's disease** A study of 300+ patients with Crohn's disease determined that the rs396991(T) allele had an odds ratio of 1.58 (CI: 1.06-2.35) and the (G;T) genotype an odds ratio of 1.64 (CI: 1.08-2.5) for the disease.* Rheumatoid arthritis** Meta-analysis of 10 different studies concluded that amongst European subjects (and not Asians), the VV (rs396991(G;G)) genotype was associated with increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis, with an odds ratio of 1.374 (CI: 1.101-1.714, p = 0.005) as compared to the FF genotype.** Although rs396991 is unlikely to play a major role by itself in susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of the rs396991(G) high-binding allele may predispose shared epitope positive individuals to the disease.Classifying the reports by immunotherapeutic treatment studied yields the following:* Studies involving rituximab:** In a study of ~200 Korean patients, the FCGR3A valine (V) allele was significantly correlated with a higher complete response rate to rituximab plus cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy compared with the phenylalanine (F) allele (88% in V/V vs 79% in V/F vs 50% in F/F; p = .002), although it did not correlate with survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).** In a study of 58 Croatian patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rs396991 did not influence response, event-free or overall survival.** A study of 49 patients receiving rituximab for previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma concluded that rs396991(G;G) patients have a 75% to 90% chance of experiencing a clinical response to rituximab monotherapy, whereas patients with at least one rs396991(T) allele have a 25% to 51% chance of responding.** Another study of 89 patients with follicular lymphoma found that rs396991 genotype was associated with the response rate and freedom from progression after treatment with rituximab. * Studies involving cetuximab:** In a study of 39 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab, the rs396991(G) (ie F) allele was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.055), by perhaps 1-2 months.* Studies involving trastuzumab:** A retrospective analysis of 1,251 patients included in a phase III trial of women with ERBB2/HER2-positive breast cancer concluded that rs396991(G) carriers (i.e. FCGR3A-158 V carriers) benefit the most, as measured by disease-free survival, from trastuzumab use compared to rs396991(T:T) (i.e. FCGR3A-158 F/F) genotypes. SNP rs403016 has been reported from a study of 119 Chinese lupus patients to be associated with an increased risk for developing the disease. The odds ratio is 2.2 (p = 0.028).

Minor allele homozygotes, i.e. rs1042522(C;C) genotypes, live on average 3 years longer than major allele (G;G) homozygotes, based on a study of 9,200+ Danish individuals. The increased longevity is speculated to be related to the increased apoptosis seen for this gain of function SNP, presumably due to ""increased robustness"" during the period of treatment after the diagnosis of life-threatening diseases such as cancer of certain types.A study of 148 individuals with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) concluded rs1042522(G;G) genotypes were more likely to be resistant to first-line chemotherapy, especially the irinotecan plus cisplatin regimen, than those with (C;G) or (C;C) genotypes (60% vs 27%, p = .014). In multivariate analysis, the (G;G) genotype was strongly predictive for shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio HR = 1.952, p = .01).A study of 57 patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy found that rs1042522(G;G) and rs1042522(C;G) genotypes were significantly correlated with a lower response rate (and worse progression) to the combination chemotherapy when compared to rs1042522(C;C) homozygotes (35.7 vs. 66.7%, p-value 0.019).rs1042522 is not associated with SLE in a study of Caucasians, African-Americans, and Asian children and adults.Implicated in type-2 diabetes based on a study of 1,161 Finnish patients.* rs2279744, rs1042522, rs17878362 and rs1625895 associated with high grade endometrial cancer/ 23andMe blog African Americans with rs1042522(G;G) in the p53 gene were 2.15 times more likely to die of colorectal cancer than those with one or no copies of a G at this SNP.

LIF levels are significantly lower in cells with the P72 allele than in cells with the R72 allele, which may contribute to the decreased implantation and fertility associated with the P72 allele.

hsa,PRNP,"rs74315405 This SNP occurs at the location coding for Codon 105 of the Prion Protein (PrP). Normally Proline, a mutation to Lucine is associated with inherited Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome. The mutant variant has a low likelihood (p=0.00-0.02) , but leads to neurodegeneration after approximately age 50 , although symptoms and onset can be highly variable. The importance of this codon has been reclassified based on further research. Normally Asn, the Asn171Ser variant was identified in a patient with Prion disease, , and further research indicated that it may be associated with temporal lobe epilepsy . However, more recent research  has indicated that the N171S variant is present in healthy members of numerous populations, reaching penetrance of 11% in Biaka Pygmies and 5% in Jamaicans. Thus this polymorphism is considered of unknown significance.  rs1799990, also known as Met129Val or M129V, is a SNP in the prion protein PRNP gene. The more common rs1799990(A) allele encodes the Met (methionine).The / 23andMe blog has a good article about the infectious Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), both people with one or two V are not susceptible to vCJD, the infectious form of CJD.Historically, since 1991 this SNP has been associated with risk for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, with homozygotes of both types apparently at increased risk compared to heterozygotes.More recently, this SNP has been related to long-term memory with (A;A) and (A;G) individuals recalling 17% more words than (G;G) individuals at 24h following learning. A further study of 12 individuals of each of the 3 possible genotypes showed that at both 30 minutes and 24 hour time lags, correlations between retrieval-related brain activity and retrieval success were negative for (G;) homozygotes (the more activity, the worse retrieval success), while correlations showed no significance or were positive for (A) homozygotes and heterozygotes. These findings suggest that the rs1799990 SNP affects neural plasticity following learning at a time-scale of minutes to hours. rs1799990(A;G) heterozygotes were significantly overrepresented (age-adjusted odds ratio, 8.47) in 39 individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a rare condition of unknown cause, compared to 400+ controls.  *rs267606980, G127V appears to protect against kuru   This SNP affects codon 200 of the Prion Protein gene.

This particular mutation is best known as the one carried by the Deater family, a large extended kindred originally from Germany but now living primarily in Pennsylvania and adjacent states of the US. This family has established the  Deater Foundation, dedicated to research and treatment of hereditary neuropathies such as those caused by their and other SPTLC1 gene mutations.; / news articleAs reported in , in this family, the age of onset of the disease is usually in the second or third decade. The symptoms begin with subtle loss of pain and temperature perception and are followed by ulcers in the toes and fingers. Symptom onset is earlier and progresses faster in men than in women. Absence of a pinprick response is observed in the early teens, even in asymptomatic patients carrying the disease haplotype. Muscle weakness and atrophy are eventually evident in most patients and may be very severe, requiring mechanical assistance such as the use of splints and crutches. In the advanced cases, sensory potentials are absent, and motor nerve conduction velocities are decreased in the lower extremities.",,,SNPedia

The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity. rs1801131 shows no consistent association with schizophrenia overall in 12 studies totaling 3,000+ patients rs1801133 is a SNP that is relatively common and has been studied for (relatively) a long time. Also known as C677T, Ala222Val, and A222V, it encodes a variant in the MTHFR gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in folate drug metabolism|metabolism. Homozygous rs1801133(T;T) individuals have ~30% of the expected MTHFR enzyme activity, and rs1801133(C;T) heterozygotes have ~65% activity, compared to the most common genotype, rs1801133(C;C). ""/ Our Take on The MTHFR Gene,"" is a 23andMe blog posting (January 5, 2017), a meta-analysis finding that the past two decades of scientific evidence as it relates to specific MTHFR-influenced health conditions to be inconclusive or conflicting, with two exceptions, 1. women with two copies of C677T variant, 2. a very rare variant that may cause homocystinuria. Their takeaway, ""Based on the existing data, scientists at 23andMe have concluded that people should not interpret their genotypes at the common MTHFR variants as having an effect on their health.""This reduced activity (i.e. this SNP) has been linked at least once to each of the following disorders (though not necessarily reproducibly):* autism* cancer, including** gastric cancer** lung cancer** head and neck cancer** renal cancer* cleft lip and cleft palate* coronary artery disease* dementia* depression* hyperhomocysteinemia* migraine* neural tube defects* pre-eclampsia (gestational hypertension)* schizophrenia* thrombosis* down syndromePubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking rs1801133 to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in  this article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. Another meta-analysis of three studies on rs1801133 stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).rs1801131 and rs1801133 have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.Based on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the rs1801133(T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).A study of 677 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for rs1801133(T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001).

A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs1801133(T) allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~5x for heterozygous and homozygous rs1801133(T) genotypes, respectively (p=0.028). If a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele was also a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).'''Note:''' Another SNP in dbSNP, rs59514310, represents the same location as rs1801133.  rs1801133(T;T) post-menopausal women said to be at 2x higher risk for osteoporosis.

A study of 3 case-control groups of Americans of European descent, comprising about 900 ARMD patients in total, indicated that having one rs3775291(A) allele reduces the odds of having dry ARMD about 30%, and being a rs3775291(A;A) homozygote cuts your odds by more than half. Specifically, the odds ratio of having dry ARMD with one minor allele is 0.712 (CI: 0.50-1.0), and for two minor alleles, 0.437 ( CI: 0.227-0.839).

ABO blood grouprs8176719 represents a site in the ABO gene, often referred to as either c.261delG or, less commonly, c.260_262insG, and it is a key SNP in determining blood group type O status. An allele that encodes either a blood group type A or type B will have a (G) at this SNP site, i.e. such an allele will be rs8176719(G). If a one-base deletion has occured at this site, removing this nucleotide all together, the corresponding allele is considered to be rs8176719(-) and encodes the most common blood group type O allele.  However, an individual will typically only be blood group type O if they are carry two copies of (are homozygous) for this deletion, in other words, if their genotype is rs8176719(-;-). If they carry one copy, they could be blood type A, or blood type B (but are unlikely to be type O). A person who is rs8176719(G;G) is likely to be of blood type A, B, or AB, but due to the existence of (rare) nonfunctional O alleles brought about by (nondeletional) mutations at other positions than rs8176719, they could at least theoretically still be phenotyped as type O.The determination of blood group types A, B, and AB through SNP analysis is reflected in the appropriate genosets.

hsa,MMP3,"SNP rs3025058 was first described in 1995 as a variant upstream of, and influencing the regulation of, the MMP3 gene. Most commonly, the version of this SNP with a run of 5 A's is called the 5A allele, and an allele with 6 A's is called 6A. Thus, the homozygous genotypes are either 5A/5A or 6A/6A, and the heterozygote genotype is published as 5A/6A. Incidentally, the MMP3 gene is also called stromelysin-1, and although there is a SNP in dbSNP in the orientation that shows the polynucleotide run as A's (rs35068180) the entry that has population frequency data is the one discussed here, rs3025058, which is from the other strand and thus shows the string as T's.There have been numerous studies in the last 10+ years linking either the 5A or 6A allele to risk for myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease. A relatively recent meta-analysis combining seven previously published studies concluded that the 5A allele is indeed a plaque-disrupting risk factor (odds ratio 1.26, CI: 1.1 - 1.4, p<0.001), while the 6A allele is associated with greater progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the 6A/6A genotype is associated with a worse progression of coronary artery disease after angioplasty. However, all these studies show a lot of heterogeneity, and gender, age, and ethnicity are all likely to alter the influence of these alleles.  rs1799864(G), rs3025058(A) and rs662 were associated with increased risk, and rs1800775(A) with reduced risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism no influence on varicose veins  *see rs3025058, which covers the same polymorphism    rs591058 is a SNP in the matrix metallopeptidase 3 MMP3 gene on ch 11.

Hence, the SNP is referred to as R577X, with homozygotes being either RR or XX and heterozygotes being RX. XX individuals completely lack the expression of alpha-actinin-3.One of the earliest report studying a relatively small number of Australian elite (i.e. ~Olympic) athletes found that, at least in females, the R allele (ie rs1815739(C)) is associated with sprinters, while the X allele (rs1815739(T)) is associated with endurance athletes.

hsa,MICA,"rs1051792, also known as MICA-129, Val129Met and V129M, is a G>A transition at residue 129 of the MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A MICA gene.It has been found in the same training cohort as above that the A allele in the patient and the donor (p=0.066 and 0.013) is associated with a reduced overall survival and an increased risk of relapse (p=0.007 and p=0.003). According to these results, the presence of the G allele in the patient associated with the incidence of cGvHD (p=0.002) and patients homozygous to the A allele had an increased risk of relapse (p=0.02). In contrast to HLA-E molecules, which are ligands for inhibitory NK receptors, MICA is ligand for activating NKG2D receptors. Patient who are homozygous for a valine at residue 129 of MICA are at higher risk of chronic GvHD after HLA-matched sibling HCT in comparison to patient who have a methionine at this position. This risk was independent of acute GvHD, suggesting that the residue 129 play a role in alloimmune responses and thus maybe protective against GvHD, (Boukouaci W, et al. 2009). MICA mismatching between patient and donor has a great influence on the clinical outcome because of the fact that MICA is polymorphic with over 84 recognized unique alleles (). According to two studies done to evaluate the role of mismatching MICA genes and risk of acute GvHD, it was shown that MICA mismatching was associated with an increased risk of grades II-IV acute GvHD but not grades III-IV acute GvHD in both HLA matched and mismatched transplant, and that was correlated notably with the GvHD of the GI tract (P=0.05).

This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers.

hsa,CHRNA3,"rs1051730, also known as D398N, is a SNP in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 3 subunit CHRNA3 gene.In two recent (2008) studies, together comprising over 6,000 lung cancer patients of European ancestry, the rs1051730(T) allele was very significantly associated with increased risk. Having one copy (i.e. being a rs1051730(C;T) genotype) increased risk for lung cancer about 1.3x, and having two copies (rs1051730(T;T) individuals) represented 1.8x increased risk. Up to 14% of lung cancer incidence may be attributable to this allele.PMID 18385738, PMID 18385676An independent study published at the same time concluded that (T) allele carriers for SNP rs1051730 are not at higher risk of becoming smokers compared to (C) carriers. However, if they do smoke, (T) carriers are quite likely to smoke more cigarettes than (C) carriers, and as an apparent consequence, they are at higher risk for lung cancer as reported in this and other studies. This study therefore links rs1051730 directly to nicotine dependence, and indirectly to lung cancer. According to DeCODE, the CC genotype at rs1051730 is associated with 0.88x risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Note: publications tend to refer to the risk allele as ""A"", however, the orientation reported for rs1051730 in dbSNP is for the opposite strand, so in keeping with reporting all SNPs in the orientation published in dbSNP, SNPedia refers to this same risk allele as the (T) allele. / 23andMe blog (T;T) once more smoke per day. rs1051730 influences how much alcohol it takes to have you feel a buzz.

This specific aspect of hip shape correlates with OA characteristics only in carriers of the susceptibility allele."" (Abstract) The -258A/G (SNP rs12885300) polymorphism of the human type 2 deiodinase gene is associated with a shift in the pattern of secretion of thyroid hormones following a TRH-induced acute rise in TSH.. After thyroidectomy, high doses of L-T4 are used to suppress TSH. Since no T3 is being produced by the thyroid, the body depends on D1 and D2 enzymes to convert T4 into the active T3. This study collected 1905 serum samples from 151 patients over 8.8 to 11.5 years and analyzed four SNPs:*DIO1-rs11206244 (D1-C785T)*DIO1-rs12095080 (D1-A1814G) *DIO2-rs225014 (D2-Thr92Ala)*DIO2-rs12885300 (D2-ORFa-Gly3Asp). Their data ""suggest that the negative feedback of FT(4) on TSH is weaker in patients homozygous for the D2-rs12885300 T allele than in wild-type and heterozygous subjects."" These patients ""have an altered set point of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis."" However, they noted that their data depended on TSH and T4 levels alone, since T3 and rT3 were measured at only one time point during the study. A common variation in deiodinase 1 gene DIO1 is associated with the relative levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine. (Published 2008). Attempted to study rs12885300 but this SNP failed quality control due to duplicate errors and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The study found significant effects with variants of another DIO1 SNP, rs2235544.See further discussion of this DIO2 gene's other SNP : rs225014  rs225014, also known as Thr92Ala, represents a variant in the deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II DIO2 gene on chromosome 14. In dbSNP orientation for this SNP, the more common (T) allele encodes the Thr (threonine) and the somewhat less common (C) allele encodes the Ala (alanine) at this position in the DIO2 protein.Polymorphisms in this SNP have associations with various conditions in the literature: osteoarthritis, psychological disorders, reduced thyroid hormone metabolism, Type 2 diabetes, and various other conditions.==Osteoarthritis== A 2012 article titled ""Increased type II deiodinase protein in OA-affected cartilage and allelic imbalance of OA risk polymorphism rs225014 at DIO2 in human OA joint tissues"" identified that the minor 'C' allele was associated with a significant, 1.3-fold higher risk of osteoarthritis (OA) relative to the 'T' allele.

The wild-type rs1047781(A) encodes the 'Secretor' allele, while rs1047781(T) encodes the 'nonsecretor' (se2 or sej) allele.This basis for FUT2 nonsecretor status is found primarily in Japanese. In Caucasians, nonsecretor status is associated with the se1 allele of rs601338, and rs1047781 genotype shows almost no variation. In Japanese, the se1 allele is absent, but 15% of individuals are non-secretors based on being homozygous for rs1047781(T;T).   From : We identified a strong association (p = 5.36 x 10(-17)) between rs492602 in the FUT2 gene and plasma vitamin B(12) levels in a genome-wide scan (n = 1,658) and an independent replication sample (n = 1,059) from the Nurses' Health Study. Women homozygous for the rs492602(C) allele (in dbSNP orientation) had higher B(12) levels. This allele is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the FUT2 nonsecretor variant encoding W143X, suggesting a plausible mechanism for altered B(12) absorption and plasma levels.    rs601338 is found on chromosome 19 in the alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase FUT2 gene.

UGT1A1*28 duplication allele inserts a seventh (TA) pair to six (TA) pairs this reducing the activity to 30% of normal.See the following SNPs, which have been merged to rs3064744 on dbSNP:rs34815109rs35600288  Although the insertion is supposed to be the minor allele, the majority of FTDNA v2 and 23andMe v2 results show II as the result, so use caution when interpreting this result.rs34815109 is one of four SNPs all describing an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. This gene encodes a protein that modifies hepatic bilirubin in order to allow it to be excreted. SNPs that reduce the activity of the UGT1A1 gene therefore tend to increase serum bilirubin levels.The rs34815109(TA) allele represents the insertion variant, which actually adds a seventh (TA) pair to what is already a string of six (TA) pairs; this reduces the activity to 30% of normal, and is thus the risk allele. The risk allele is commonly referred to as the UGT1A1*28 allele, and it is homozygous in ~10% of the US population.Risks associated with the rs34815109(TA) allele are almost always associated with the homozygous (TA;TA) genotype, with smaller (or no) effects seen for rs34815109(-;TA) heterozygous carriers. These risks include:* An increased risk for breast cancer is reported in premenopausal African-American women, based on a study of 200 women. The reported odds ratio was 1.8 (CI: 1.0-3.1, p=0.06) for carriers of one or more UGT1A1*28 alleles.* In colorectal cancer patients being treated with irinotecan, adverse side effects (neutropenia and/or severe diarrhea) are reported to be strongly associated with the number of UGT1A1*28 alleles. Patients homozygous for the *28 allele are 3.5 times more likely to develop severe neutropenia compared with individuals with the wild genotype.

In the United States, it's estimated that sickle cell anemia affects 70,000&#8211;100,000 people, mainly African Americans. A New England Journal of Medicine study conducted in the US reported an average life expectancy of 42 in males and 48 in females . The landmark 1949 Science paper titled "" Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease by Pauling established the molecular basis for this sickle cell anemia and introduced notions that will become central to molecular medicine.  Sickle cell leg ulcers are common complications of sickle cell anemia . As of 2010, despite the fact that this complication has been recognized since the early times of sickle cell disease, there has been little improvement in the efficacy of its management and clinical outcome over the past 100 years . In a  study, investigators found significant associations between rs736839 (18q21.1) and sickle cell leg ulcers. Using the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm to control FDR, this SNP was the only one found with FDR under 10%. In this study, the odds ratio for rs736893 was 1.95, with 95% confidence interval of (1.35&#8211;2.82). Homozygous C is associated with elevated levels of risk for sickle cell leg ulcers. In contrast, having at least one of T is considered less risky. This case-control study involved 387 cases and 920 controls. The genotype associations were adjusted for sex and age because men and older individuals are more likely to be afflicted .Although not in a gene, rs736839 is adjacent to SMAD7, which is part of the Transforming Growth Factor&#8211;b/Bone Morphogenetic Protein (TGF-beta/BMP) pathway. In a separate case-control SNP association study, IGF1R and genes in the TGF-beta / BMP pathway has been linked to sickle cell anemia .The Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions. In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that the TGF-beta signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGF-beta superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.

It's role in cytokine production appears to be the key factor in this SNP's association with disease prognosis (but, interestingly, no role in disease susceptibility has been found to date).rs12212067(G), the minor allele, is connected to the downregulation of TNF and several other proinflammatory cytokines in response to various antigens, and, the upregulation of IL10, a cytokine associated with anti-inflammatory effects. As elucidated in the cited study, this appears to explain the better outcomes for rs12212067(G) carriers of treatment for two auto-immune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. As might be predicted for an infectious disease relying on an upregulated inflammatory response (which isn't happening as much with these carriers), this also leads to worse outcomes for carriers afflicted with malaria.; More recently, a different group of researchers have reported that, at least in the patients they studied, rs12212067 is a far weaker predictor of the clinical outcome for Crohn's disease patients than is rs2066847, a SNP in the NOD2 gene.    rs1935949 is an intronic SNP in the FOXO3 gene.rs1935949 demonstrated a significant association with longevity but only among women (odds ratio 1.35, CI:1.15-1.57, adjusted p=0.0093).

hsa,GSTP1,"This SNP, in the GSTP1 gene influences asthma risk; the (A) allele encodes the Ile, while the (G) allele encodes the Val. This SNP is also known as GSTP1Val105, or GSTP1 Ile105Val.Despite evidence of antioxidant effects of vitamin E in vitro and in animal studies, large, randomized clinical trials have not substantiated a benefit of vitamin E in reducing inflammation in humans. In healthy control subjects, the effect of &#945;-tocopherol supplementation on the production of inflammatory cytokines appears to be dependent on an individual's genotype. These genotype-specific differences may help explain some of the discordant results in studies that used vitamin E. Persons having the alleles AA or AG had an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon supplementing alpha-tocopherol (the most common form of Vitamin E in a North American diet) while those with GG saw a decrease. This  research paper shows that 13- to 21-year-olds exposed to tobacco smoke at home, with this mutation had more severe asthma than those without the mutation. rs1695 is also mentioned in this  bbc articleSeveral papers published findings associating GSTP1 Ile105Val genotypes with bronchial, childhood, or atopic asthma.

Note that POAG is typically considered a disorder that is recessively inherited, and that the age of onset is known to be quite variable even for a given single mutation.A functional study in 2008 concluded that this mutation (the Y81N variant) should be considered a hypomorphic allele rather than a mutation, since the enzymatic activity of corresponding protein was in between that of a classic CYP1B1 mutant and that of a normal protein.More recently, the variant has been categorized as benign in ClinVar. In ExAC, it is clearly a rare variant, with an average minor allele frequency of 0.006, but showing the highest frequency in Finnish European populations (0.04).Overall, the significance of this variant is unclear.

A study in Quebec showed an association in children with mutations in MTHFD1 having increased risk for heart defects, possibly in a folate status dependent manner (IE more so if their mother was not getting enough folate during pregnancy). A 2014 meta-analysis of nine studies totaling 4,302 cases of children born with neural tube defects concluded that Caucasian mothers carrying rs2236225(C;T) or rs2236225(T;T) alleles were at increased risk, of about 1.5 - 1.7x, of having affected children compared to mothers with no (T) alleles.

(article retracted due to artefact in genotyping).  The rs3087243 SNP is also known in the literature as the CT60 G>A or the +6230G>A polymorphism, and it is located in the CTLA4 gene. In Asian (Japanese) populations, the presence of an rs3087243(G) allele represents a 1.3 fold increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease, and for those with autoimmune thyroid disease, a 1.5 fold increased risk of type-1 diabetes. However, in individuals without autoimmune thyroid disease, no association was seen between this SNP and type-1 diabetes. The authors speculate that earlier studies may have reported associations between this SNP and type-1 diabetes that were actually primarily based on the association with autoimmune thyroid disease.This same SNP, rs3087243, has also been implicated as a (minor) risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A study of 2,000+ European RA patients led to a calculated odds ratio of 1.13 (CI: 1.03 - 1.24) for the rs3087243(G) risk allele. In a study of 395 Spanish patients with lupus, rs3087243(G) allele carriers were calculated to have an odds ratio of 1.71 (CI: 1.18-2.49, p=0.003, p(corr) = 0.006).In a different study involving recipients of liver transplants, although also with Spanish patients, the rs3087243(G) allele was significantly associated with acute rejection (odds ratio 1.49, p(corr)=0.038). Patients who lacked this allele had the lowest risk of acute rejection development. Allograft survival data did not show statistical differences between genotypes.  rs2292399 and rs2903692 both significantly associated with type 1 diabetes odds ratio 1.37 and 1.28. A joint analysis revealed that rs3087243, rs2292399, and rs2903692, but not INS rs689, were significant risk factors for the cooccurrence of AITD  One report based on a study of 480 Danish families indicated that the rs3772534 SNP in the CBLB gene indicated an increased risk for developing type 1 diabetes, and that there might be co-inheritance with the rs3087243 SNP found in the CTLA4 gene. However, a subsequent study based on over 2,000 parent-child trios (ie families) failed to find any evidence of either effect.  rs4553808, also known as A/G-1661, is a SNP in the upstream activator sequence of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 CTLA4 gene. This gene encodes the CD152 antigen.A study of 165 Swedish myasthenia gravis patients concluded that the rs4553808(G;G) homozygotes had an odds ratio of 0.05 (CI: 0.00286-0.874, p=0.0023) for the disease compared to healthy individuals, while the rs4553808(G) allele showed a less dramatic reduction in risk, with an odds ratio of 0.578 (CI: 0.373-0.897, p=0.015).        rs733618, also known as T/C-1772, is a SNP in the upstream activator sequence of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 CTLA4 gene.

Note that a benign variant of this SNP (c.693C>T) also exists as discussed below.Only the A allele at rs12948217 confers risk to Canavan disease. A person with the CC, CT, or TT alleles is not a carrier; someone with the AC or AT alleles is a carrier; and people with two AA alleles are affected with the disease.Note that due for technical reasons, the vast majority of direct-to-consumer companies using DNA chips (microarrays) for genotyping do not distinguish the benign T allele from the pathogenic A allele. As a result, raw data from these companies that reports (A;C) and especially (A;A) is quite likely to actually represent the benign (C;T) or perhaps (T;T) genotypes. This type of error applies only to data derived from microarrays (specifically, Illumina microarrays such as those used by 23andMe and Ancestry) and does not apply to data generated by sequencing.  rs28940279, also known as c.854A>C, E285A or p.Glu285Ala, is a SNP in the ASPA gene.rs28940279 is one of several known causal SNPs of Canavan disease. Canavan disease is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. It is a childhood onset disease which begins in early infancy. It is characterized by disordered muscular behavior (e.g., hypotonia, hyperextension) and neurological symptoms, such as blindness, developmental and cognitive delays. The neurological findings appear to be due to demyelination and leukodystrophy. Histology indicates the presence of spongy degeneration; cytology confirms astrocytic swelling of normal neurons and abnormality of astrocyte mitochondria.  Ultimately, sufferers become extremely ill and die on average at 18 months of age.rs28940279 is a SNP in the aspartoacylase ASPA gene.   The A-C transversion results in a substitution of alanine, a hydrophobic small-chain amino acid, for a glutamate (which is both large and charged). This substitution, E285A, is at a residue predicted to be part of the catalytic domain of aspartocyclase. This missense mutation is predicted to have drastic effects on the catalytic domain because of the vast difference between the amino acids.In particular, this substitution is common in Ashkenazi Jews, with carrier frequency approximately 1 in 60 individuals.  This suggests that some degree of founder effect is responsible for its prevalence within the Ashkenazi Jewish population. In particular, one study suspects that the mutation originated in the Vilna area, in Poland or Lithuania depending on the political timeperiod of origin.  This suggests that it is a newer variant than others found in the more broad European population. rs28940574, also known as c.914C>A, A305E or p.Ala305Glu, is a SNP in the ASPA gene.rs28940574 is one of several known causal SNPs of Canavan disease.

Pharmacogenetics and antipsychotics: therapeutic efficacy and side effects prediction.  origins associated with an independent aspect of decision making in a learning paradigm rs1800497, a SNP also known as the TaqIA (or Taq1A) polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor DRD2 gene (even though it is actually located over 10,000bp downstream of the gene), gives rise to the DRD2*A1 allele, whereas rs1800497(C) gives rise to the DRD2*A2 allele. The minor allele (i.e. A1, rs1800497(T)) is associated with a reduced number of dopamine binding sites in the brain , and it has been postulated to play a role in alcoholism, smoking, and certain neuropsychiatric disorders.The reduced number of dopamine binding sites may play a role in nicotine addiction by causing an ""understimulated"" state that can be relieved by smoking (and/or use of other drugs). It may also be associated with reduced response to errors and increased addictive behavior.A wide variety of reports have been published over more than ten years either linking rs1800497 to aspects of nicotine use and smoking cessation success, or finding no such association. A meta-analysis of 41 such studies published in 2004 concluded that overall the association of rs1800497 with such phenomena was statistically weak.  This same group published (in 2009) a study showing no association between rs1800497 and improved response to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), contrary to their previous study.More recently, a relatively large study of over 700 patients attempting to kick their smoking habit using the drug bupropion determined that smokers homozygous for the A2/A2 genotype were more successful than A1/A2 or A1/A1 individuals. The A2/A2 smokers were more than three times as likely, relative to placebo, to be abstinent at end of treatment (35.2% vs. 15.1%; odds ratio = 3.25, CI: 2.00-5.28) and at 6 months of follow-up (26.7% vs. 12.2%; odds ratio = 2.81, CI: 1.66-4.77), whereas not so much by 12 months (16.3% vs. 10.7%; OR = 1.70, CI: 0.95-3.05). Basically, A1/A2 and A1/A1 genotype smokers didn't gain anything from using bupropion versus placebo; bupropion only helped A2/A2 genotypes stop smoking. In a study of individuals in the Polyp Prevention Trial with any, multiple (>/=2) or advanced colorectal adenoma recurrence after 4 years, compared to those without adenoma recurrence, rs1800497(T;T) individuals were significantly associated with all advanced adenoma recurrence (odds ratio 2.40, CI: 1.11-5.20).  The authors speculate this increased risk of adenoma recurrence (and an association with colorectal cancer) may be related to SNP-associated differences in alcohol and fat intake.A 2014 preliminary study links an individual's ANKK1 rs1800497 genotype as likely to experience greater positive subjective effects following cocaine exposure, including greater 'high' and 'like', and these individuals may have increased vulnerability to continue using cocaine or they may be at greater risk to relapse during periods of abstinence. The study states that replication of these findings is necessary to confirm these findings.SNPs rs6276, rs6277, and rs1800497) in the human DRD2 gene are associated with decreased D2R expression and function, as well as high blood pressure.  Data supports the hypothesis that D2R function has protective effects in human renal proximal tubule cells hRPTCs and suggest that carriers of these SNPs may be prone to chronic renal disease and high blood pressure.  SNPs, rs1800497 and rs2283265, located near and within the dopamine receptor 2 DRD2 gene, respectively, were significantly associated with improvements during working memory training (p < .003 and p < .0004, respectively).

The odds ratio was 1.4 (p<0.005). An earlier meta-analysis comprising over 9,000 schizophrenia patients concluded pretty much the same thing: the Cys311 (rs1801028(G)) allele frequency led to an odds ratio of 1.43 (CI: 1.16-1.78, p<0.001) for this risk allele. A study of ~120 Chinese patients with schizophrenia concluded that Cys/Ser heterozygotes may not respond to risperidone treatment as well as Ser/Ser homozygotes.A paper has been published describing mistakes made in assigning allele status for this SNP:* (free full text) Misassigned alleles can annihilate efforts to control quality in otherwise well-designed genetic association analyses. To date, the issue remains underreported, as is exemplified by studies of a diallelic DRD2 missense variant in schizophrenia. For this variant, allele frequency data have been either misassigned, or incorrectly cited on four consecutive occasions. Contrary to conjecture, low heterozygosity has not guarded against the error with regard to rs1801028, a SNP that features a canonical base pair transversion, G:C.In the case of rs1801028, rs1801028(C) is the more common allele, encoding the amino acid Serine at position 311, whereas rs1801028(G) encodes Cysteine.
